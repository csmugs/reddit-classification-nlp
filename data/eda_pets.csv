0,dogs,"So my miniature poodle can't last more than 10-15mins in a room alone without barking.

I'm not sure if this is actually separation anxiety because he can still eat the kong and fall asleep when we are away for 10-15mins. But once he finishes the kong or wakes up because of a noise, he then realises he is alone and starts barking intermittently which eventually becomes a howl. Also, he is able to rest somewhere else in the house (like in the corridor) without seeing us if the doors to our rooms are open and we are in the house, it's just when he is enclosed behind shut doors that he starts barking.

Right now, he is 13 weeks old, almost 14. I have no plans to take him hiking **just** yet. I‚Äôm thinking like. Summer time, maybe late Spring time. All of the hikes we would be taking would be less than 5 miles each, as I am physically disabled and can only push myself to walk so far. Usually, I can walk up to a mile on a good day. Other days, its sub 300 ft. Now, obviously, I wouldn‚Äôt be taking him on my bad days. My bad days are few in between right now thankfully! However I‚Äôm still going to make sure he gets 100% of his daily exercise, and then some!

3,dogs,"I‚Äôm new to reddit and came across this sub. I do not understand the aversion to using positive and negative punishments. I‚Äôve only been involved in dog sports (IGP) for a year, but the professional certified trainers that I see all agree that there is no such thing as ‚Äòpositive only‚Äô training. Our dogs require levels of correction that warrants the use of prong collars, slip collars, and e-collars.

In our training style, we teach our dogs to learn what the words ‚Äòyes‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äô actually mean. We train with emotion. We work on actually getting our dogs to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô what we want, not just respond to a particular word with a certain behavior. I‚Äôd wager 90% of my training is positive and negative reinforcement, but positive and negative punishment is still required. 

Granted, we use working lines from Eastern Europe which are specifically bred for protection and civil work, but dog psychology still applies. What works for a Shepherd should work for a poodle mix right? 

My trainer has been to the world championships several times, they have many dogs with IGP3 titles. They have dogs working in the police forces, the borders, and for the military. 

I keep hearing on here how using these methods creates a bad relationship with your dog, and I just do not see it. 

My puppy is 10 months old, and we have been training in IGP since he was 10 weeks. We bond really well. He enjoys working; he cannot wait to get on the field. He knows that he must listen to me. He doesn‚Äôt roll over and submit either. He knows how to use his brain and is confident because I've given him that confidence by teaching him to understand me. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄòChip‚Äù means you‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve asked correctly and you‚Äôre going to be compensated for it either now, or in the future. The word ‚Äúwrong‚Äù means you have done the wrong thing, but it wasn‚Äôt necessarily bad, just incorrect. This will result in negative punishment, such as removing a high value item, stopping the exercise, or ignoring the action. The word ‚Äúno‚Äù means you have done an undesirable behavior that is ‚Äòbad‚Äô and you will be corrected for it. This might involve a pop on the prong collar, a shock, or movement being restricted by force. 

I see nothing wrong with this. My pup is world‚Äôs ahead of most other ‚Äòpet‚Äô dogs at his age. He heels, can hold a long down, can fetch, drop, give, bring, wait, etc etc. He walks without a leash and will not chase small animals, people, or dogs. He has no fear or aggression. If he doesn‚Äôt know what to do, he sits and looks at me for instruction. His tracking is pretty decent, he can follow a scent and indicate his articles. His protection work is coming along. He knows how to focus and  harness his ‚Äòaggression‚Äô towards the helper, all while being sweet and playful with everyone when not being asked to work. 

I‚Äôve had ‚Äòpet‚Äô dogs my whole life, but this is my first working breed. After working with the professionals, seeing the results, and comparing them with friends and family who have ‚Äòpet‚Äô dogs which are trained more in line with this sub, I must admit that the methods used by my IGP trainer work better. They just do. 

I‚Äôm not here to say that you cannot train however you wish, but I fail to see how you could train a dog without using positive and negative punishment? When you have a dog that can potentially kill someone physically, a command MUST be followed. There is no exception. I fail to see how you can teach a proper understanding of the word ‚Äòno‚Äô without some form of communication that associates a negative connotation to the word.

I‚Äôm just curious to hear other opinions on this.",Positive and Negative Punishment,1673990776,3611,32,648,4

She had a limp for a few weeks and originally the vet was concerned it was a torn ccl but never got a positive ""drawer"" test and the injury healed.

While I could have covered the surgery it would have been a bit tight and made me consider pet insurance, specifically ASPCA as it's one of the only ones that covers bilateral injuries.

I was walking him through our apartment complex and an old man was following me around and yelling at me for not having a muzzle on my dog(he didn‚Äôt need one but some people are scared of GSDs).

We live in the end house of a cluster block, I.e. no back garden but a small amount of grass as a non-enclosed front garden.

18,dogs,"Ok so my 6 month old black lab/ dalmatian mix puppy has been diagnosed with server separation anxiety.  Her vet didn't want to put her on meds yet since when we first discussed it she was only three months old and we all wanted to wait and see how she adjusted to her new life with us.  We hoped that with lots of time adjusting and of course taking classes with other dogs she would somehow grow more reassured that everything would be alright and she was safe and loved.  Well fast forward to now and things haven't progressed as we'd hoped.  We've talked with a few behavioral professionals about what's going on but still not really seeing anything that we would call results.  She is a submissive dog and is quite skittish about a lot of things despite our attempts to expose her to a lot of different situations to help her to adjust to life in our family.  She seems to have really bonded to me.  I guess since I'm the mom of the family she sees me as a kind of mother figure to her too and gets really upset when I leave the house or even the room even if others are in the room with her.  I've even had to at times cook with one of her crates (she has three long story) in the kitchen so she can see me at all times but she still barks and whines and cries because I am not giving her my undivided attention.  Well, this weekend while I was washing some dishes in the kitchen she was in there with me but I didn't have her on a leash or even in her crate.  She wandered around the room but much to my surprise she actually wandered out of the room and down the hall.  She did this a few times throughout the last couple of days.  Does this mean that she is starting to feel more secure and that maybe just maybe she is starting to overcome her separation anxiety or is this something completely unrelated?  I don't want to get my hopes up so I need someone that's been there with this type of issue to give it to me straight.  We have a professional on standby along with her vet in case something more in depth needs to be done to help her but I am really hoping we won't need to do that.

She‚Äôs an extremely sweet dog and likes nothing more than playing and having her belly rubbed, however she struggles with going to the bathroom in our backyard, and results in frequent accidents inside the house. I‚Äôve tried to encourage positive training methods, but I‚Äôm not frequently at my house (usually work or staying other places) so I don‚Äôt believe this positive training is truly being enforced like it‚Äôs being said. 

Recently, I found her locked in the kennel while our other dog (who was pretty much trained when we got him) was out and free, but not leaving her side. I asked my mom whats going on, and she says she found some training method online where you ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù all the dog‚Äôs actions and keep them in a kennel otherwise, and that would create an association for them to go to the bathroom outside. So she‚Äôs stuck in a kennel for 90% of the day and is only let out and leashed to get food and water or go to the bathroom. My mom is understanding, so I instantly shut this idea down and explained how I thought this would actually backfire and make the issues worse, and make her associate outside with being locked up.

I‚Äôm looking for training methods, or things that can encourage her to go outside. She has no incontinence issues, but I think she simply doesn‚Äôt see our backyard as a space for her to go to the bathroom. Would a grass patch or another dog attracting item in the back help?

But that‚Äôs literally what happens to a good portion of our pet dogs. Or even cats / especially cats. 

**Not all dogs or cats find the vet aversive and can remain neutral or calm or even happy. In which case that‚Äôs amazing** But most dogs/ cats aren‚Äôt going to be that. And some even have fear aggression at the vet ranging from mild to severe, while others cope by shutting down completely. Especially when they already have had a traumatizing experience(s) previously. 


**In some cases, such as emergency situations / life or death / urgent care necessities, their physical health is more important because it‚Äôs quite literally life or death or serious injury/ illness**. But for the other part, for the routine stuff‚Ä¶

Is it not *inhumane* to restrain dogs against their will to the point of: fear aggression OR complete shut down OR other forms of severe anxiety (screaming, pooping, etc) for routine things such as nail clips, vaccines, blood draws, and other non-invasive **routine** things?? 

I know most pet parents aren‚Äôt going to care that much about how their pet feels during this because routine vet visits are usually 1-2x a year and last for an hour max. And **I know that vet staff just need to do what it takes to get the stuff done because they have a schedule and need to do the things the pet parents are taking their pet there for** 

But as a **human** who DOES have medical trauma primarily 1 event as a child that ruined all medical ‚Äòprocedures‚Äô for me (even non-invasive things such as eye drops, eye checks, etc) . I completely understand the sheer panic, even when I electively go in to the doctors or specialists and they perform tests on me, it‚Äôs like another force takes over and i very easily pass a threshold where I go from a normal patient to one with a lot of anxiety and I can‚Äôt cooperate with the staff even at my age in my mid late 20‚Äôs. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I‚Äôm ashamed. As an adult, I have the common sense to know I‚Äôm acting worse than a ‚Äòchild‚Äô but I also know I have unresolved medical trauma that causes me to physically feel this way. I‚Äôve been told ‚Äòget over it‚Äô ‚Äòstop acting like a baby‚Äô ‚Äòchildren act better than you‚Äô - I agree. But it‚Äôs just deep rooted trauma from when I **was** a kid, I‚Äôm just no longer a kid now. 

I‚Äôm able to communicate with staff, nobody is holding me down against my will anymore (yes that‚Äôs happened on more than 1 occasion for elective procedures such as tooth extractions on different occasions and LASIK) and I know that it‚Äôs NOT going to hurt, yet I feel my body reacting with sheer panic. If I‚Äôm pushed past my threshold (moderately easy) I‚Äôm pretty much not consolable and I need to take a break otherwise I go into severe fight or flight mode due to the past trauma I have. 

With my own experience, I can totally understand how my dog feels. He has vet aversion and will become fear aggressive if pushed past his threshold. He had traumatizing vet experiences as a puppy which affects him to this day. How can we expect dogs to be OKAY with this and then chalk it up to them ‚Äòbeing dramatic‚Äô????

I see pet owners all the time seeing their dog in extreme distress over routine things like nail clippings, ear cleanings, eye drops, etc and they say ‚Äòoh they‚Äôre being dramatic it doesn‚Äôt hurt‚Äô - but they fail to realize and empathize that regardless of the pain level (or lack of pain) that it‚Äôs still traumatic for their dog and they‚Äôre not being ‚Äòdramatic‚Äô. and every time their dog or cat is exposed to this type of trauma behavior.

This is more of a rant of my own thoughts. I wish vets would advocate for this more to inform owners, because some owners genuinely don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. I wish owners would care more about their dogs psychological well being. I wish vets would explain options for next time to pet owners such as: sedation, cooperative care, happy visits, and general slow desensitization to basic routine vet care. 

I wish more places offered classes to work on this as well. 

Do you think this is an issue, or are you generally unaffected? Even if your dog is neutral or positive at the vet, what about the other dogs who struggle? 

Personally, I relate a lot more than maybe the average person because I do have medical trauma and I know what it‚Äôs like. I know what it‚Äôs like to panic and people keep pushing and telling me to stop acting like a baby, instead of slowing down just for a minute and reassuring me. I‚Äôm not blaming them: they have a job, they have a schedule. It‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt blame anyone for: lack of compassion and empathy for someone struggling.

I am thinking I'd like to make a decision and get the dog in the next 4-8 months, so I have plenty of time to make an informed decision. 

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*My family had dogs when I was a child, all rescues:*

\- *Golden retriever/Alsatian x called Buster. Adored him, but I was never strong enough to manage him on the lead.* 

\- *Norwegian Elkhound called Thunder. Drove me mad barking and wanting to be let out at night (my room was the only one downstairs)*

\- *Jack Russel x called Bobby. I was very young so I don‚Äôt remember much.* 

\- *Currently an old Daschund/rottweiler x (don‚Äôt ask, we have no idea) called Jett. Adorable sleepy old man dog.* 

*They were all more country dogs than home dogs ‚Äì mostly walked off lead, parents had a big garden so were able to come in and out of the house as they wanted, happy hanging out outside in the yard when we were away. They were family dogs, but really they were my dad's and he took most responsibility for them. (We were all girls, and I think we had male dogs so he wouldn't feel so outnumbered).* 

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

*I would prefer not to buy from a breeder, but I haven‚Äôt ruled out having a puppy*

3. Describe your ideal dog.

*Comfortable travelling in the car with me, and chill enough to bring them to friend‚Äôs home for a weekend. Comfortable with visitors to the house.*

*Affectionate. Likes sharing my space. Happy to coexist with other dogs, e.g. when meeting up with other dog owners for walks or going to stay with a friend. Happy to come with me places (dog friendly cafes and bars for example).* 

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*These are the ones I have considered so far but I* *am not necessarily emotionally committed to any of them.* 

*Cockapoo ‚Äì They‚Äôre cute, affectionate, and I have some experience looking after them. Although mostly only available from breeders, so not totally sold yet.* 

*Lab/golden retriever ‚Äì I‚Äôve thought about applying to adopt a dog that has been withdrawn from assistance dog training, which are usually this breed.* 

*I thought about a greyhound, as my sister has one and they are lovely dogs. However, my best friend has a small yorkiepoo, and I feel like this combination would be doomed not to be friends and I would prefer they could be.* 

*I also think cocker/King Charles spaniels are cute, but I know literally nothing about the breed and how suitable they would be for me.* 

*I don‚Äôt really know enough to make a definite decision though.* 

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

*Just deal with life without being anxious or aggressive.* 

6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

*No*

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*Probably about 30 mins morning and evening, with longer or higher intensity exercise a few times a week. I‚Äôd like them eventually to be able to come jogging with me 2-3 times a week. Nothing crazy, 5k or so. Hiking occasionally (weekends).* 

*I live next to a canal towpath, so daily walks would usually be there, although there are loads of parks around if I wanted to drive there.* 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

*I honestly don‚Äôt know. I think at first I would take them to a groomer and maybe ask them to show me a few times until I am comfortable with what I need to do? Brushing would be ok I think, as long as the dog was comfortable with it.* 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

*I‚Äôm open. Probably the larger side of medium as a maximum, and I do find tiny dogs a bit ridiculous but anything between those two points.* 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

*I would like to avoid excessive barking (some is obviously to be expected), but I would prefer it into to be a constant background noise or over-reactive.* 

*Shedding : less would be preferable but I don‚Äôt really have as much of a problem with is as excessive barking. Same with slobber.*

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

*Not critically important, but would be nice sometimes.* 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

*Snuggly and affectionate, but ideally not super needy and prone to separation anxiety. Not necessarily a lap-dog, but one that likes to share my space/sit on or near the couch.* 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

*In an ideal world, they would perk their head up and/or saunter over to receive a head scratch and be like ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs nice to see you friend‚Äù. In reality a bit of excitement is ok, but aggression would be a problem. Ignoring/being cautious would also be fine, but I wouldn‚Äôt want it to cause anxiety for the dog.* 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

*Again, some barking/reaction is ok but aggression would be a problem.* 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

*Ideally no. Definitely not one that looked scary while being aggressive, or was big enough to present a danger due to aggressive behaviour.* 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

*I am a student, and can work from home. Sometimes I work on campus, but this is super flexible. At the moment I go in about 11-5/6*  *a few times a week, but if I have a dog I would probably reduce this a lot. It is only 5 minutes away, so even if I did have to go in for slightly longer days I can pop home. I am imagining that I would walk the dog and work from home in the mornings, then go in the afternoon to campus for a few hours if I am struggling to focus at home or have a meeting and then be back early evening.* 

*Once I have finished my PhD in 2 years it is likely I will have to go into the office 2 days a week, and I would hope to share dog care with my friend or find a good day-care for at least one of those days depending on affordability.* 

*I definitely wouldn‚Äôt want the dog to be really stressed if I went out buy groceries or to the gym or to the pub for a bit (2-3 hours, occasionally) as I am single and I would find it quite restricting to not be able to do any of these things without finding dog care, so some level of self-sufficiency is important.* 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

*I have a lodger who if generally favourable towards the idea of having a dog, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to walk or care for the dog. At maximum if I have left the dog at home I would ask them to ring me if there was an emergency. He is only living there relatively temporarily (6-9 months) so I am considering myself a solo dog owner.* 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? *No*

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

*Not in the near future. However my sister is currently pregnant, and at some point I would expect that they and their kid/s might visit once or twice a year.* 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  *I own my home.* 

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? *UK. Not that I know of.*

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

*Summer only occasionally goes above 32c, and winter is usually 5-12c with the occasional cold snap below 0.*

We found the perfect dog‚Äîthe right size, temperament, and the ""cons"" are not deal breakers.

We have carefully gone over expectations with each other, and both want what is best for the pup. In most ways, it feels like a win-win.

However, this owner has a young granddaughter who is clearly attached to this dog. They play together, snuggle together, and I've even seen pictures of the dog sleeping in her arms. It is undoubtedly going to break this little girl's heart when her grandmother rehomes this dog, even if it is necessary.

31,dogs,"I have worked in the pet care industry for almost ten years now and have learned a lot in that time. I want to make a comprehensive guide for anyone looking for their next dog.

\*Please note that the lists below are not exhaustive and don't include all possible breeds under each category. It is purely meant to provide an example of what kinds of dogs best represent each category.

**Popular dog breeds that require professional grooming at least once a month:**

* Cocker Spaniels
* Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
* Goldendoodles
* Labradoodles
* Poodles (All sizes)
*  Schnauzers (All sizes)
*  Yorkies
*  Lhasa Apsos
* Shih Tzus
* Malteses
* West Highland White Terriers
* Airedale Terriers
* Welsh Terriers
* Scottish Terriers

Grooming is an important part of dog ownership. Professional grooming can cost anywhere between $35-$200 depending on your location, what you want done, and the size of your dog. Grooming is something you can learn to avoid grooming costs at a shop, but it's something you can't forgo if you want one of the breeds listed above. They get matted and need regular brushing and trimming to keep that under control. Don't get one of these dogs if you can't afford to groom them regularly or aren't willing to learn.

**Breeds that shed....a lot:**

* Labradors (English and American)
* Golden Retrievers (some shed more than others)
* German Shepherds
* Huskies
* Samoyeds
* Pugs (some more than others)
* Shelties (mostly in the spring)
* Australian Shepherds (mostly in the spring)
* Cattle dogs

These dogs need regular deshedding. This can be accomplished by buying a deshedding brush and using it once a week (give or take, depending on the dog).

**Hypoallergenic Dogs:**

* Poodles
* Doodles (any breed mixed with poodle such as Labradoodle and Goldendoodle)
* Bichon Frise
* Affenpinscher
* Any breed that doesn't shed, really. 

**Highly Trainable Dogs:**

* Border Collies
* Shepherds (German, Australian)
* Poodles/doodles
* Retrievers (Golden, Lab)

Any dog can be trained, but some breeds can be more stubborn. 

**Stubborn Dog Breeds:**

*  Akitas
* Shiba Inus
* Huskies
* Jack Russells
* Bulldogs

**Loud Dogs:**

* Huskies
* Alaskan Malamutes
* Shiba Inus 
* Basset Hounds
* Beagles
* Bloodhounds
* Coonhounds
* Miniature Schnauzers

**Quiet Dogs:**

* Cavalier King Charles Spaniels
* Greyhounds
* Whippets
* Great Danes
* Shar Peis
* Rhodesian Ridgebacks
* Newfoundlands
* Saint Bernards
* Basenjis (they literally can't bark)

**High Energy Dogs:**

* Shepherds (German, Australian)
* Collies 
* Huskies
* Cattle dogs
* Terriers (Jack Russell, West Highland, Yorkie, Schnauzer)

These dogs will need daily walks, yard time, and play sessions to keep them happy and non-destructive. 

**Low Energy Dogs:**

* Great Danes
* Newfoundlands
* Saint Bernards
* Greyhounds
* Pekingeses
* Pugs

Hope this list helps anyone who is trying to find the perfect breed of dog that suits their lifestyle. Always check out your local shelter first before going to a breeder. Mutts make fantastic pets! Don't limit yourself to a purebred. Also keep in mind that a dog is a fifteen-twenty year commitment that will require vet care (shots, dentals, spay/neuter, yearly exams, medications and screenings when they get old, etc.) Be sure you can afford these things before welcoming a pet into your life. Dogs are living, breathing creatures with wants and needs.

45,dogs,"**MPs passed the bill banning the sale and use of electric collars or chokers for pets. If the ban is approved by the S√©nat, France will join other European countries that have legislated in this area. Le Monde journalist Mathilde G√©rard reports.**  


They can be found at prices ranging from 50 to several hundred euros. They are sold over the counter in large pet shops or sports equipment stores. Spiked collars, chokeholds and electric collars... these so-called ""training"" devices sold to dog owners (and more rarely cat owners) who want to control their pets' barking, prevent them from running away or pulling on the leash, inflict physical and psychological suffering on the animal, and could soon be prohibited in France.

On Monday, January 16, MPs voted almost unanimously (111 votes for, 5 against) to pass a bill banning the sale of these coercive tools and punishing their use with a fine of ‚Ç¨750. The text had received the approval of all political groups in the Assembl√©e Nationale on January 10, in the Committee on Economic Affairs. It was therefore in a climate of agreement that this proposal was approved on its first reading. The rapporteur for the bill, Renaissance MP Corinne Vignon, said it was ""modest but expected, meeting a strong demand from citizens.""  


For Ms. Vignon, banning these collars is an issue of the accountability of dog owners, as well as professionals (trainers and veterinarians) who interact with them. ""The problem with collars is that they are sold over the counter and the owner is not even aware that they are abusive,"" said the MP, who was appointed president of the Assembl√©e Nationale's working party looking into animal welfare in late December 2022. ""But an animal trained on pain and physical restraint is an animal that will have physical and psychological problems, and is more likely to bite.""  


How widespread is the use of these collars? Sales figures are not known, but a study conducted in France in 2018 suggested that one in five dogs has worn one of these devices. In a statement issued in November 2022, the French Association of Pet Veterinarians (AFVAC) said that ""the use of training collars has harmful consequences on the physical and psychological health of the animal"" and that ""their use in training is not justified.""

She was 950 gms. One of the vets told us to deworm all the puppies, including her and also start liver tonic and something to build the immunity. So we gave her 1ml of Drontal Puppy and we got her home that day itself. She was barely opening her eyes in these 3ish weeks (whereas all her littermates were pretty active and looked like 4 weeks). Once we got her we kept her wrapped warm and was advised to give rice and pumpkin pureed with chicken stock or Cerelac. She pooped loose and spaghetti like worms shot out. In the evening it was same with around 7-8 such worms which came out. She was still eating and had her wobbly movements. Since the current vet became unavailable, we took her to a nearby vet. She advised to give Samolac Pro(milk sub) and continue the other meds. Now at night she pooped and puked completely watery stools with Rice like worms all over. She refused food at night and was sleeping. In the morning we took her to a novice hospital and they gave her oxygen, warmed her up (her temp was 92¬∞F) and then gave her Saline and meds (prescription below). She was 800 gms. Came back home and after a while she started tremorong even with heat pad and heater. So we were told to rent oxygen and give her and keep her warm. In 3 hours she passed away crying, last poop was black and writhing in pain. 
I have so so many questions: 

We wanted to understand if puppies who are so weak can be given deworming?

Can a puppy so weak take saline? 

Were the medicines to much?

I live in India and these are the stray dogs (there are around 155,000 of them in my city). They are neither vaccinated nor dewormed nor sterilized. We got her home as the people around told us they will throw or poison her. There are no particular stringent laws and street dogs are treated with utmost disgust and hatred. We have adopted 2 other babies from the streets. We feed them daily and try to get them adopted/rescued. There are no NGOs who response and most vets do not want to deal with stray dogs (specially in Kolkata, India).",Puppy Passing Away,1673973489,2432,18,461,3

____________________________________

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * No, she had a large (110lbs!) bulldog before. But he was a very chill dog so she didn't do much training beyond the basics. 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * She intends to rescue

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * She wants a smaller breed, no bigger than 15lbs but preferably under 10lbs. She wants to train them as a psychiatric service dog. She wants them to be cuddly, and not excessively barky (some barking is fine.) Low to medium grooming needs. Something that only needs brushing a few times a week or can be clipped. Basically just not a long double coat like a rough collie or keeshond lol. She's not interested in brachycephalic breeds, nor 'little white dogs"" such as shih tzu, Bichon frise, Havanese. If it comes in white and has buggy eyes she's not interested. Her words. 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * She was interested in a papillon as that's what I'm getting, but I worry they'd be too high energy for her? She's in her 60's and sedentary, she mostly prefers to sit and watch tv while she crafts. Though she also intends for the dog to help get her more active. 

Other than that she's not sure. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * to be a psychiatric service dog. 

    6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

    * No. 

    **Care Commitments**

      7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * She can commit to a couple hours per day minimum, she doesn't work or anything so she will be with them all the time. Though a dog with less physical requirements would be better, she can do more mental stimulation. 

    8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * An hour or two minimum. Mostly walking. Definitely no dog parks. 

    9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * She'd prefer something she only has to brush a few times a week or that can be clipped. Nail trimming, ear and teeth cleaning she can do herself. Anything she can't do she'll take to a groomer for. 

    **Personal Preferences**

    10)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * Preferably under 10lbs, but no bigger than 15lbs. 

    11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * Preferably less shedding but it's not a priority. I think as long as it doesn't blow it's coats like a husky she'd be happy.

    12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Not important, and not really possible/safe in our area anyways. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * She wants a cuddly dog, one that will enjoy being petted and hopefully sit in her lap. 

    14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

    * One that is eager to please but is capable of entertaining itself if needed. 
    
    15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * no or limited barking. Preferably not greet strangers but not be upset at their presence. 

    16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * No. 

    17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

    *  she doesn't want excessive barking or drooling. No biting, food aggression or reactivity. She understands any dog could develop these traits, but prefers not to get a breed where that's more likely. 

    **Lifestyle**

    18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * At most 2 hours when we do a large shopping trip, but that only happens twice a month. She is hoping for it to be a service dog so they may come on these anyways. 

    19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * I will be getting a dog myself so I'm fine with her getting one. I would hopefully have minimal involvement with her dog but I can help out as needed. 

    20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * We currently have two elderly cats but they likely won't be alive when she gets a dog. I will also have my own dog m, a papillon. 

    21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * Only when passing on the street or in our building. 

    22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * We do rent, but there's not pet restrictions. 

    23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * Toronto, ON Canada. There is a pitbull ban. 

    24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * Average summer temps 24¬∞C, average winter temps -6¬∞C.

We live in the end house of a cluster block, I.e. no back garden but a small amount of grass as a non-enclosed front garden. We have some nice parks around us so we could still take any dog for a good walk. I work full time and therefore I'm out the house between 6am and 4pm. My gf works from home most of the week however twice a week she has to take the train into London to go into her office. We also look after my 5yr old daughter 2 - 3 times a week so would need a dog that could handle primary school age kids. 

Ideally we would like a medium - small dog and one that could go with my gf into London as her office allows dogs. The breeds we were considering are corgi, dashund, and miniature schnauzer.

I do a good job at controlling my own dog and she's not very aggressive and she's somewhat tiny compared to other breeds. It's the other dogs in the neighbourhood I'm worried about? Are they barking because they intend to attack or are they just curious? And if they somehow escape, what's the likelihood that they will attack?

57,dogs,"I have a dog (sweetest little rescue) with separation anxiety. If I leave him at home, alone or not, he sits by the door and waits for me to get home. He‚Äôs better than he used to be and doesn‚Äôt hurt himself or anything, just lies down by the window looking for me. I have a camera there and he just chills. If my renter is home or I get a sitter they says he sometimes comes over when they‚Äôre eating or whines a little bit but otherwise sits there. 

I‚Äôve left for up to 5 days before but all my overnights he‚Äôs always been at a sitter‚Äôs house. He gets a little worried when I drop him off but soon is having fun playing with other dogs or children and is fine. Sometimes he gets a little sad but is fine. 

I have a trip in just over a week where I‚Äôll be going abroad and will be gone nearly two weeks. So longest time leaving him. Also I have to have a sitter stay at my place. Originally was going to have a friend stay here but fortunately my partner who works from home moved in with me. She gets along with him great and he loves her. So that‚Äôs great. 

My question is on the best way to handle me leaving. If I just drive off, he‚Äôll wait by the window for me to get back. I‚Äôm thinking it might be best for us to all leave together and then me say goodbye and put him in the car with my partner and have them drive home. That way he won‚Äôt see me leave the house and be wondering when I‚Äôll get back. Maybe that‚Äôll be worse though. Not sure.

If they‚Äôve got little feet, ears, or any other decorative doodad he wants to use his far back teeth to cut them off.

I‚Äôm guessing he gets a different kind of satisfaction from cutting through fabric compared to normal hard chews. Because he doesn‚Äôt avoid hard chew toys. He also loves them! So I want to find/make a treat so he can do this kind of chewing on something that won‚Äôt possibly kill him.

It has to be something not hard/crunchy, but kinda chewy. And it can‚Äôt be too small or too soft or he‚Äôll just inhale it. (For example, the sticks they give you in a bark box get eaten a minute after you give it to him.) Any ideas?",Treats for a specific chewing desire?,1673970377,920,37,177,6
59,dogs,"Ever since we had my pup, she has a vomiting episode every few weeks or so (getting a bit more frequent lately).  Like clockwork, it happens between 4-6am.

15  minutes later she's always completely fine and looking for belly rubs.   The days before and after she's completely fine with her normal  appetite.  I can't think of anything we're doing in those days that's  different to cause her to throw up.  So I'm just confused.

The  only thing I can think of is that she's on an empty stomach, which is  why it's early in the morning and probably the time of day she's the  hungriest (We feed her at 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM).  But I don't know why it  wouldn't happen more frequently then.

I  know dogs tend to just have random vomiting fits from eating something  or a bug, but the identical nature of my dog's vomiting leads me to  believe there's some culprit somewhere.

My pup (born in March 2021) started off on science diet large breed puppy, which she seemed to really enjoy it. Fast forward several months/bags later and after opening a new bag she wouldn‚Äôt eat it after a few days. Talked to my vet and she had said that science diet had been changing formulas due to supply chain issues and to try switching her to Purina pro large breed puppy. Did that and similar issues. She seemed to like it at first but after a new bag she would kind of eat it but you could tell she didn‚Äôt really like it. 

Fast forward like 6 months. My family dogs have been on Nutrasource for many years, I was making plans to move in with my bf and taking my families Jack Russel with me. My bf was feeding his dogs royal canin so I decided to transition my Jack Russel to that. No issues with that. My vet recommended my pup stay on Purina Pro large breed puppy for as long as possible because of an early onset hip dysplasia diagnosis. 

Several months later‚Ä¶. vet tells my bf both his dogs are overweight and he should switch them to a weight management food. Recommends the brand Victor. Around the same time my Jack Russel is diagnosed with very early kidney disease, vet gives prescription for science diet k/d. They all freaking hate their food now. 

3 month check in for blood work for my Jack Russel and the vet is alarmed he‚Äôs lost 5lbs. Yeah‚Ä¶. Because he won‚Äôt eat his food. He takes tiny nibbles of it and that‚Äôs it. He gained 4lbs back when he was in a bland diet of chicken/rice because he had pancreatitis, he was actually crazy excited every feeding time for that. Now he‚Äôs back to his kibble and would rather starve apparently. Vet said we can switch his prescription to another brand and see if he likes that. $85 for an 8.5lb bag he only ate a bit of. 

They all have terrible smelly gas/poop. My pup occasionally throws up bile in the morning because she has an empty stomach. 

I‚Äôve tried wetting the kibble with warm water/broth, toppers, boiled chicken, a bit of rice, etc. they just eat around everything that isn‚Äôt their kibble. 

They have all gotten very naughty in regards to begging and trying to steal food (they don‚Äôt get people food).

‚Ä¶ but not all dogs are. Sofa is a privilege in which there should be rules, especially when it comes to children. 

A dog should wait to be invited on the sofa and it shouldn‚Äôt be a race to find the comfy spot. 

A dog shouldn‚Äôt climb all over you when you‚Äôre on the sofa or think it‚Äôs play time. 

Here is a few reasons why this is important. 

1. What if you have a hot drink and the dog jumps on you?

2. What if they are muddy or wet and come running in straight on the sofa?

3. What if your child is on the sofa? It‚Äôs never ok for dogs to climb all over children. 

4. Dogs who are Possesive of the sofa often have no rules when it comes to the sofa. 

All extremely important things to think about, but we are going to focus on point 3. 

So many dogs are surrendered to rescue because of incidents involving children. It‚Äôs not even funny. 

Dogs and children should have a mural respect for one and other at all times. 

Just as we wouldn‚Äôt except a child climbing over the dog (well the smart people wouldn‚Äôt) we shouldn‚Äôt except a dog climbing over a child. 

Child sits on the sofa, then the dog is invited up, anything less then calm and controlled the dog is off the sofa. Don‚Äôt mess around with this. 

If your dog lunges at, runs into, knocks over or does anything other then be calm around children it isn‚Äôt ready to be on the sofa with them. 

Remember ! Nobody thinks they have a problem, until they do, it‚Äôs usually followed up with ‚Äòhe has never done that before‚Äô or ‚ÄòI just don‚Äôt understand why she did that‚Äô by then it‚Äôs often to late and disaster has happened. 

Dogs thrive on clear, consistent rules. It creates a happy, content dog who knows what‚Äôs expected of them. Inconsistencies often lead to confused and problematic dogs.",This Dog Is Safe To Be On The Sofa‚Ä¶,1673962640,1755,35,331,9

Overview: My dog appears to have failing kidneys, maybe pancreatic cancer. She won't eat her food, but I can tell she wants to eat and asks for treats, then won't eat them. We usually have to hand feed her and can get her to eat tins of spaghetti (in tomato sauce) and tomatoes. She will sometimes eat fish but not as easily. She's had peas, but we stopped giving them to her after reading something about kidneys. She would eat baby food at one point but went off it. She is really picky with food now and might eat something once and then not again. What can we try that is safe? I managed to get her to eat a couple of vegetarian scotch eggs last night which is the first time she's eaten anything like meat outside of one specific bacon flavour treat she always seems to eat but we can't give it to her due to it being unhealthy. We have tried carrot, swede, potato, etc, and she's now gone off that it appears its just spaghetti and tomatoes that we have more success with feeding her. 

She's lost a lot of weight. They have tried something to flush her kidneys or something like that, but they couldn't give as much as they'd like. She had mirtazapine for appetite for a couple of days and is now on Benazapet for blood pressure with the vet saying to leave the other thing for now. She will have a blood pressure check in a week.

She's happy within herself and appears to have an appetite but turns her nose up to food. She doesn't want meat or anything with carbs outside of the spaghetti.

Suggestions for safe food that she might eat would be really appreciated.

78,dogs,"Hi guys, I have a 14mo GoldenXLab male and he‚Äôs an absolute psychopath around other dogs. 

When it seems like every dog on the planet is just chill and playing like normal, mine is jumping over other dogs, kneeing them in the face, doing sneak attacks (laying down in predator mode until the dog is right next to him and then proceeding to jumping up and scaring them) and insists on playing with dogs that don‚Äôt want to play with him. His social skills are all over the place, but he‚Äôs a sweetheart and really just wants to play lol. 

Where I‚Äôm significantly concerned is at the fact that he hates being barked at and will get mad at dogs that try to ¬´¬†regulate¬†¬ª him. He‚Äôs never bitten or attacked any dog, he‚Äôs just very vocally defensive. 

We don‚Äôt go to dog parks for this reason, but we do love going to off leash trails because he‚Äôs so much easier to manage. He has a fantastic recall, hates being far away from us, and will immediately move on from trying to play with a dog when he sees us walking away. He‚Äôs also never displayed his defensive behaviour on trails and I immediately leash him when I see him getting a little too invasive. 

We got him fixed about 3 weeks ago so I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll chill a little once the testosterone leaves his body entirely. 

However, I‚Äôm a little puzzled about his defensive behaviour. Is it a good thing that he sets his boundaries with dogs that get too dominant with him or that incessantly bark in his face OR should I be concerned that it can escalate into something more serious ? 

In general, I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs energy is related to his age, his hormones or if being off his rockers is just part of his personality.

85,dogs,"I have a Shih Tzu named Lily who is less than 3, we have had had her since she was a pup. At first we just had a tiny apartment, just me, girlfriend, dog, and one cat. Everyone got along fine, dog had fun playing with the cat and loved seeing new people in the house.  


However that didnt last, we got evicted and now live with my mom. Currently, we dont have a bedroom, our bed and computers are in the living room. This house now has my mom and my brother as well as 3 cats. Mother is always home but in her own room and my dog Lily doesnt mind her at all. My brother is out 90% of the time and has made 0 effort to socialize with Lily and even done things to somewhat antagonize her (even if he wasnt doing it intentionally). She doesnt like him and will bark like shes trying to scare him away from the living room. Im working on properly socializing these 2 currently.  


The real problem however is the cats... The cats used the living room as their playground before we moved in, and now Lily feels she needs to defend the living room as her own territory. The cats will often try to sneak in or even aggressively assert themselves into the living room, and Lily obviously fights them back. Ive tried so hard to get them to slowly interact with each other so they can relax, but i feel like they are locked in a power struggle and theres no clear victor.  


I was told that they just need to work things out... That was six months ago, things have not changed. I need their fighting to stop, not only am i worried about the animals getting hurt, but I have already been hurt pretty badly from their fights. Usually Lily just tries to get them out of the room, but one time she cornered a cat under a desk, and the other cat ""came to the rescue"" by latching on to my face...

My 5 yr old German Shepherd is named Valkyrie. I adore her.

I got into a vet and he did a handful of tests and an xray. Her uterus isn't swollen but she definitely has an infection that he believes is open pyometra. They gave her pain killers and a super dose of antibiotics, along with 7 days worth of twice a day antibiotic pills. 
This morning she was better but still not herself. This afternoon and evening she almost seems like new. Her energy is up and she finally ate. She wouldn't take her kibble but happily scarfed down a chopped up steak and some pumpkin puree. 
I certainly do plan on having her spayed once she is thru her cycle. Does this sound like a typical experience with pyometra? She seems to have bounced back very quickly which is kind of the opposite to a lot of the stories I've read and heard of with pyometra.

It was so unsettling that I didn't know what he was saying at first, and once it became clear I walked faster and turned into some random apartment complex and tried to hide.

109,dogs,"I love dogs, and honestly I would adopt as many dogs as possible if I had the means. I have two rescue pups of my own that are currently living with us in a duplex, but they get a ton of exercise and stimulation despite this. The duplex is temporary because I'm trying to buy a property that lets them have the most freedom possible (obviously the current housing market complicates things...). 

My downstairs neighbor moved in fairly recently. His 60-something year old mother was living downstairs, and she passed away in late 2022. Her family seemed to stop by out of obligation, and her house was genuinely cold and unwelcoming. For the most part, her house was unfurnished, and she rarely left her bedroom due to limited mobility. She even got bedbugs without ever leaving her house.....

My girlfriend and I tried to check in on her as much as possible, and she would occasionally kindly ask us to buy her a bottle of wine because she didn't have a car (which we did twice until we found out she had advanced stage cancer with a history of alcoholism). She passed away months later because the cancer really took over, and her adult son ended up moving into the house. He moved in with his gorgeous young pitbull. His dog is not neutered, but seems very well behaved. He gets along fine with our dogs, but this neighbor always pulls the dog away insisting that he doesn't like other dogs (although his tail is always wagging, he has never growled, and he keeps trying to run and play with our dogs). We've also realized that he definitely does not get opportunities to appropriately get his energy out. I regularly watch this dog get let out in the front yard to take care of his business for a few minutes, then he gets escorted right back inside (where he stays alone for most of the day until his daddy comes home, usually takes some time to get high, then lets him out to pee). 

This man just got a new female puppy a couple days ago. I'm assuming he got her to breed with the male pittie. We've been hearing her scream for hours because she's been locked up in a cage (likely sitting in her own urine and feces). My girlfriend finally found this man's number and called to see if we can somehow get into his apartment to let the dogs out real quick. He insisted that he'd be home in a few minutes (which turned into almost 2 hours). On the call, my girlfriend explained that we would be more than happy to take the pups out in the future if he knows that he'll be gone for a while. He seemed to get uncomfortable, but he was polite and thanked us for the offer. Puppy was still screaming uncontrollably, so my girlfriend called him again later. He found it funny and again stated he'd be home soon. Which now has been over 3 hours since he said, ""I'll be home in a few minutes."" I really don't know what to do. I won't bother calling authorities over a dog just given that I've called CPS over actual child abuse just to have it immediately swept under the rug. Even if this dog is taken away from him, he'll just get a new puppy tomorrow and do everything the same way. Plus he would likely become vindictive towards us given the personality traits I've witnessed. I have no idea what to do.

TL;DR  My neighbor has had a dog who he does the bare minimum for, and he just bought a new puppy that desperately screams when left alone for hours because my neighbor's out being social (not at work). I don't know how to approach this issue. The neighbor is fairly friendly (more so just civil), but he would take it as a personal attack if I brought this up to him.","Neighbor's dog gets the bare minimum in terms of care and attention, and now he got a new puppy...",1673929436,3575,98,666,19

111,dogs,"I live in an apartment complex in LA with my dog Harley (\~4 years old, Papillion mix, female). A few months ago, one of my neighbors on my floor got a big lab puppy. 

Here's the problem: my living room has a huge window looking out into the walkway, which never was a problem for Harley before. However, the owners of the lab constantly not only walk past the window with their dog unleashed, but sometimes let him linger there; my unit is near the laundry room and trash shoot, so I think they have him just hang out there while they do their laundry and whatnot. 

This happens multiple times a day everyday and since there is just a thin layer of glass separating the neighbor dog and Harley, Harley goes absolutely nuts every time. It's become a huge problem because I work remotely, not only conducting meetings but sometimes holding live, on-camera interviews from my apartment to thousands of viewers. It's impossible to predict when the neighbor dog will walk past, causing Harley to lose her mind and ruining an interview. I also feel it's made her more anxious in general, with her constantly monitoring the window during the day now. 

I feel kind of bad about it -- because their dog is an angel and it's mine that's the problem child -- but I'm thinking about asking them to please limit the amount of time their dog spends outside my window.

I have an 11 month old German Shepherd mix. She is spayed and is in perfect health. She is my first ever female dog so I just want to get some peace of mind that this is normal behavior before I speak to her vet!

For the last few evenings, she has begun chasing her tail or I suppose, chasing her genitalia? She will then incessantly lick her vulva. She will also hump the air and while licking herself, she will almost uncontrollably hump whilst sitting on the floor. The cycle repeats for around 15-30 minutes. This is the first time I‚Äôve seen this behavior from her.

Forgive me if I seem like an idiot as again I‚Äôve only owned male dogs and never seen this before - Is this normal for female dogs or could this be some kind of infection? Is she just excited or happy? Is this just her age?

133,dogs,"Hi folks! I read through the rules and I hope this is ok to post here, as I am *not* seeking actual medical advice. Rather I am trying to determine if I am having an abnormal experience with my dog‚Äôs veterinarian, who I don‚Äôt know that well. Apologies in advance for the novel I am about to write. 

 I own a 6 year old male springer spaniel. We‚Äôve moved around a *lot* since I got him as a puppy, at times living on the road for my career. As a result it‚Äôs been difficult to establish lasting relationships with vet clinics. We‚Äôve lived in our current town for a little over a year and I‚Äôve been taking my dog to the same clinic during this time. He has received vaccines there, had a wellness exam, and had a minor procedure for a grass seed lodged in one of his goofy ears. The front desk people are‚Ä¶not ideal, but I have had no issues with the vets or techs.  

Recently I discovered a mass on my dog‚Äôs rib cage. It developed very suddenly and I was immediately alarmed. I called our vets office and requested the first available appointment. I didn‚Äôt care which vet in particular he saw, as we‚Äôve had decent experiences with all of them. I just wanted the soonest available appointment. The vet we saw was one we had seen in October. She remembered my dog and some of his quirks, and agreed that this mass was not there in the fall. She wanted to do a fine needle aspiration. I agreed. After examining the cells, she informed me about what she was seeing and recommended that the mass be removed and sent off for histological examination. She answered my questions, though I admit I was a bit dazed and trapped in the spiral of ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt be happening, why is this happening, this cannot possibly be happening to me‚Äù.

At the front desk after the appointment I scheduled the procedure for a week later. I requested that the vet who we saw that evening do the surgery, as it made the most sense to me to try and stick with someone who knew my dog and had performed the initial cytology.

The surgery was today. I dropped my dog off at 8am. At 9am, I received a call from the vet herself. She said my dog was doing well and the blood work came back good. She also informed me that she had discovered my dog‚Äôs microchip in the same area as the mass (he‚Äôs had it since he was a puppy, I know migration of chips is relatively common). She said it would be interesting to see if that was associated with this and that we could maybe be ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù. She said my dog was next in line for the surgical suite and that I would receive another call when he was out of surgery. 

Around 11:30am I received another call letting me know that my dog was out of surgery, awake, and doing well. This time it was a vet tech on the phone. This did not surprise me, as I had actually been pleasantly surprised to hear directly from the operating vet earlier in the morning. I asked if she had any information about how the mass had presented, what sort of margins they got, or any other information relevant to a diagnosis. She said she did not, and that she was not present during the procedure. I asked if she knew if the microchip was involved at all. She did know about that and was able to tell me that the microchip was not associated with the mass after all and that it was left inside my dog, not removed with the mass. She said that I could pick my dog up at 2:30pm, and that the vet would have notes from the procedure available at that time. 

I was a mess for the rest of the afternoon and went into the vet shaking and nauseated, ready to hear bad news. I paid my bill and was told that a tech would bring my dog out. The tech came out and we discussed post-surgical care, pain management, and she told me that the mass had been sent off for analysis. I asked again if she had any information from my vet regarding anything about the mass. She did not. I was taken aback. Someone else then brought my dog out and between him bolting for the door and a dog on a flexi-lead trying to get in his face, we left without any other questions. As I was headed for the door the vet came out and greeted a woman who appeared to be a close friend. They were hugging and talking about their personal lives, so I wasn‚Äôt about to butt in asking about my dog‚Äôs potential tumor. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me or my dog as we walked past. 

When I got to my truck I looked over the paperwork I was given. There were post-op instructions as discussed with the tech, and an itemized bill. No copies of the blood work, or any notes about the surgery itself.

To be clear, I was not expecting to be given a diagnosis or prognosis today. I know the mass has to be analyzed first. However I was expecting to be told about what the vet found and told her take on the actual removal of the mass. 

I have seen so many vets over the years and I am so paranoid and protective of this dog that I can‚Äôt figure out if this seems normal/ok. I‚Äôve already decided that I will be emailing and requesting a copy of the bloodwork and any surgical notes, particularly because I have already scheduled an appointment with a specialist at a larger clinic in the nearest city. They will obviously need this information at that appointment. 

I‚Äôm upset with the lack of communication and now I‚Äôm questioning if we should find another primary veterinarian at another clinic. My options are limited, again due to the size of the town I live in. There is one more clinic that is equally as recommended as the one we currently go to. At the same time, I‚Äôm afraid to switch vets when we are in the middle of figuring this out. While I am anticipating the specialist being my primary guide for any treatment options, if my dog is really sick I need a local vet I can trust and who will work with the specialists to (hopefully) treat whatever this is.

It's a skin-related thing, not the knees or joints, but I've heard they would cherrypick ANYTHING to avoid covering the cost. Some said they consider diarrhea as a pre-existing condition for some cases...  


Did anyone successfully get the ACL surgery covered by pet insurance with this kind of past vet records? Any tips to avoid their cherrypicking?

- Never had this issue with us before
- Lived with us at same location for 3 months
- no new food
- no new toys
- we didn‚Äôt change detergent or deodorant or anything of the like
- we live in Oklahoma (it is windy here often)

152,dogs,"First, apologies for the format I‚Äôm on mobile. So I‚Äôm making this post about my friend‚Äôs German Shepherd, Koda. She‚Äôs around 2 years old and was a rescue, my friend fostered her when she starting when she was a few weeks old and ended up adopting her. As far as we know, she has no history of trauma: she was apparently ‚Äúfound on the street‚Äù and then dropped off at the shelter. I put that in quotes because we did a DNA test on her and found out she is a pure bred German Shepherd with absolutely no family history of diseases or health problems, so we think that someone had actually stolen her from a police or military puppy breeder or something. Anyways, for the past 2 and a half years Koda has always been extremely playful and happy-go-lucky with people. She‚Äôs always loved me and always wants to play whenever I‚Äôm over. My boyfriend who loves dogs also met her back in August and Koda absolutely loved him, the two would not stop playing with each other the whole evening. 


My boyfriend met Koda again for the second time (we‚Äôre long distance, so he doesn‚Äôt go over there as much as I do) this past Friday and the minute he came through the door, Koda immediatley started uncontrollably barking and peed herself, she ran away from him with her tail tucked between her legs. Once she stopped barking, Koda remained scared for the rest of the night and would hide behind doors with her head peaking out. Her ears were always tucked down, she was always crouched, her tail was always tucked between her legs, and anytime my boyfriend would walk around she would run away to the opposite direction. She was acting exactly like my grandfather‚Äôs rescue who had been previously abused. My friend told me that after we left that night, she went back to her usual behavior of playing and being relaxed. On Sunday, I came over by myself and Koda acted the same exact way she did with my boyfriend. It was very odd because before Friday, the last time I had been over was the Sunday before and Koda was her usual. 


Another detail about Koda is that she is not around men that often, but she‚Äôs never had a problem with them either. My friend takes Koda to daycare twice a week while she‚Äôs at work and up until now, Koda has always loved daycare. We just found out that a male employee who started at the daycare in mid August was recently fired for unknown reasons. I suspect that maybe he mistreated Koda, so my friend called the owner of the daycare today and she assure her that there was no way Koda was mistreated by the male employee. She also said that Koda is not in her usual routine right now so that might have ‚Äúthrown her off‚Äù. She also said that sometimes dogs develop anxiety when they‚Äôre a little older. In my opinion, I call bs. To me Koda isn‚Äôt just acting anxious, she‚Äôs acting scared and traumatized.

156,dogs,"I live in a fairly large city in the U.S. with a little less than 600k population. I found a dog in the middle of the road on my way to work this morning. Almost hit him actually. No collar or identification and his overall condition has raised red flags. To be honest, I‚Äôm a little apprehensive about posting him on the lost and found pet FB page for my city and finding his owner. 

His fur was badly matted. He also looked to be injured, to what extent I don‚Äôt know. There was dried blood around his mouth, blood in one eye, and a possible laceration on his nose. It seemed that the extent of his injuries was centrally on the face. Given that he wasn‚Äôt wearing any identification and that his visible injuries were seemingly only on his face, I‚Äôm concerned that he was abused and dumped. Another odd thing I noticed was the fact that his teeth are in overall pretty decent condition. At least from what I saw when he had yawned. White and intact. Also, I haven‚Äôt found a single missing pet post anywhere with his description. Possibly a shitzu/Yorkie mix. About 10 lbs or so.

He let me scoop him right up from the road. Not a single display of aggression. In my car I had the heat going and put on some smooth jazz to help calm him. It worked pretty well. After some time trying to soothe his tremors, I stretched out my hand calmly and slowly, gauging his reaction. He sniffed my hand and licked it. Just a sweet but scared boy.

I took him to a shelter to be looked over by their vet. Thankfully with how early in the morning it was, he was immediately checked in. I can‚Äôt get any updates when I call because the shelter was technically closed in observance of Martin Luther King Day. I even drove by after work and their gates were closed. :(

What can I do in this situation? What options are there if I or a family member wanted to adopt him? How does a shelter usually proceed with a case like this? Is he getting the treatment he needs there? Am I wrong to assume his owners of mistreatment?

159,dogs,"My neighbors have two large dogs. They have a small fence area in their backyard but are usually off leash (neighbors play frisbee with them, do training exercises, etc). The dogs have constantly charged at me when I pull into my driveway or leave my house. When we first moved in, the male owner would come outside and apologize in person, tell the dogs to go inside, and assure me it won't happen again. The third or fourth time, the male owner came out and said the dogs aren't used to anyone living in our house so they think it is a part of their yard (neighbors used to let them off leash in what is now my yard). 

Well, it is 8 months later and the dogs still charge at me on occasion. When it happens, I have to sit in my car and wait for someone to get them or they will try to bite me. I also have three small children getting in and out of the car sometimes. I feel like it is only a matter of time before someone gets severely hurt. Is this something I should call animal control about at this point? Should I tell the owners first? The most recent time the female owner just said a quick ""sorry"" and called the dogs back in, so I didn't get the chance to bring it up. 

We live in a small suburb in the country. When I asked my family what to do, my dad (who is an avid dog person) told me to just shoot the dogs. They said the police around here won't do anything about dogs and animal control will only take the dog if you have it in your possession or if they have actually bit someone. I obviously don't want to do this, but I also don't want my kids to be attacked. I could use some alternative advice.

I kind of have to schedule her water drinking because otherwise she would drink water all day and constantly need to go outside. I fill her water bowl up a few times a day and she immediately drinks the entire thing. Her pee is always very clear so she must be very hydrated.

I have 4 dogs, 1 bought, 3 rescued. 3 of them are very good, well socialized, off lead, know loads of tricks and love people.   


The other one is a stray mongrel, who we've had for 2 years from a pup. We've been training him constantly for 2 years with positive reinforcement, had behaviourists in and most recently sent him away to a residential training course. 

The trainers believe that it's appropriate to use negative reinforcement (along with positive), in a Jekyll and Hyde kind of way e.g, lots of praise, with short blasts of extreme negative when problems occur. The particular things they used are can of coins and spraying him with a water bottle. Unfortunately, this seems to work on him and he doesn't seem to be having any negative side-effects. 

He is the sweetest dog and loves everyone once he gets over the initial explosion of aggression. He's never bit or attacked anyone, but he growls and barks at everything. Using the combination of the 2 above seems to fix this. 

**My take on this**

This is one of the very few, limited times it's appropriate to use negative reinforcement. The reality is that it's affecting our quality of life and we're close to the point of rehoming. I think the water squirting is difficult to do in public and will create a negative association with water, so i'm considering something i've always spoken out against - vibrating shock collar. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this really specific case, a quick search of the history of this subreddit seems to be pretty consistently against this, and I would've agreed before seeing him after being negatively reinforced.

TLDR

1 out of 4 dogs is feral and untrainable. Put significant time and money into training. Recently sent to residential training and they recommend some negative reinforcement for his very specific case.

But really I'm just lost here, I no longer will let her get close to any kids at all but I just want to curb that aggression altogether.

I gave him 4 days at the vet, but I quickly ran out of money since I had to take care of 2 puppies( my other puppy got parvo too at the same time but she made a full recovery, she is now eating by herslef ). After those 4 days at the vet I took him home and administered him 100-200 ml of Ringer every 8 hours as well as 5ml of metoclopromide orally (syrup) every 8 hours to stop the vomitting. Right now I don't know what to do to him. I only have 50 bucks left in my pockets so not enough for even a day at the vet. I tried force feeding him eggs with a tiny bit of sugar and it seemed to work but he kept drinking lots of water and just vomitted all out.

\- My dog ate nearly a whole bottle of prescription strength painkillers

\- Total cost to me was \~$12000

\- 11 days after submitting the claim, Lemonade paid 80% less a $250 deductible, and I did not get the rider to cover exam fees (\~$500), so I got \~$9200 back.

\- - -

Last November my dog ate a bottle of painkillers and in my terror in the waiting room of the ER I spent hours trying to figure out whether Lemonade would cover the claim. I couldn't find anything, which added to my anxiety, so I am posting here in the hope of alleviating someone's anxiety in the future. Obviously I cannot guarantee Lemonade will cover any given claim, but I wanted to share a positive experience compared to all the negative ones I found at the time.

Also, a lot of the reviews on their site say things like, ""I love that my claim was paid out in just a few days,"" which sounds like something you're supposed to say, but not something you say if they actually paid out your claim, so they weren't helpful.

Anyway. Here was my experience.

On November 30th I go get my prescription painkiller refill, leave it on my desk, then go to the gym. I don't think twice about it since my pup hasn't gotten into any mischief since she teethed.

When I get home, I find 5 vomits, and pup is drowsy on my bed. Prescription bag is on the floor, torn open, prescription bottle is chewed open, I count 12 pills left. The bottle had 60, so she ate 48 of them. This is naproxen, 250mg each, so she had 12,000 mg. She weights 18 kg, so had 666mg/kg. Lethal dose for dogs is 10 mg/kg depending on who you ask, certainly no higher than 100mg/kg.

Long story short, after the most stressful two weeks of my life, she lived! After the initial ER visit I had to drive to a different city to have a specialty procedure done called therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Basically, naproxen is an NSAID, which binds to the plasma in the blood. In TPE they remove the blood, separate the plasma, and replace it with donor plasma, then put it back in (sort of like dialysis). I know what you're thinking... that sounds expensive. Yes. They initially quoted me $16,000 to do two rounds of TPE. They ended up only doing one which was about $11000. That also included a 4-day stay and a bunch of take-home medication.

After picking her up I had my local vet do labs periodically to make sure her kidneys weren't failing. She ended up needing to go back to a local hospital for 2 days which was another $1400. The labs all totaled about $300.

So the actual total I ended up paying up front for everything (TPE, additional hospital stay, labs after the fact) was $12,302. I was initally charged for much more than that ($16,000 + $2000) then refunded when not as many services as quoted were needed ($5000 and $600, respectively).

I submitted everything over $100 (all but 5 of the lab checks) on 12/8.

I didn't hear anything until all the claims were approved on 12/19, 11 days later. I did reach out to ask for a time estimate since I wanted to know if I needed to take out a loan; I didn't want to leave it on my credit card. I got back a polite but generic ""it takes as long as it takes"" sort of deal.

I had a $250/year copay and 80% coinsurance. Additionally, they did not cover exam fees, as this is an add-on. I'm sure I waived it when I bought the policy, but I wish I hadn't (or could at least recall how much it was). She had seven exam fees (first ER, then ER where TPE was done, one a day while there, then f/u hospital stay) totaling about $500.

So the total I got back was $9007.

Then just now I finally had the energy to submit the remaining lab fees totaling about $200. All but one of these were instantly approved so I got 80% of that back, $160. The one that wasn't instantly approved I put a different procedure to match the invoice (""blood test"" vs ""cbc,"" not sure why my vet billed a different procedure) so I'm guessing they insta-approve anything small that's already been approved for a given accident and manually approve anything new.

My only complaint, really, is that you have to use your phone to submit claims. It's smooth and fast compared to how I've had to submit claims to my health insurance in the past (actually mailing things‚ÄîLemonade lets you upload invoices as attachments) but I submitted 8 claims in all and I would rather have been able to batch submit, somehow, or at least use a mouse and keyboard. Though I guess most people don't submit 8 claims. But this is a small gripe for my dog being alive, and me having $9000 I wouldn't otherwise have. And it's still 1000x better than mailing something in.

And next year I'll look at how much adding the rider for exam fees is.

190,dogs,"I have never posted on this thread before, but saw a pet insurance ad on Reddit for nationwide (with comments disabled) and I realized I need to share my story and warn pet owners about nationwide as a pet insurance provider.

Our sweet 14 year old collie mix passed in March of 2022. It was the worst week of my partner (32M) and Is (32F) life. We took her in for a cough and walked out on Monday with our vet telling us that she had cancer‚Ä¶. Everywhere. We spent the week doing absolutely everything we could to get her into radiology to see if there was ANYTHING we could do. We truly were heartbroken and not ready as it was so sudden. This is important for the story because once the wonderful people were able to sneak her in, we received multiple pieces of documentation of her status and prognosis.

After she said goodbye, we finally began picking up the pieces and filed our pet insurance claims that had racked up quickly over the previous week. We followed all the rules and sent in all the documentation.

Their response?

‚ÄúCancer is not a diagnosis‚Äù

They wanted to know the exact type of cancer and refused to fulfill our claims. So in the middle of heartbreak, in the worst situation a pet owner can be in, they demanded further ‚Äúproof‚Äù despite receiving official documents from radiology departments listing ‚Äúcancer‚Äù.

196,dogs," Hi all, I've posted here for recommendations before  - this time I have a better idea of what my SO and I would like plus we are finally financially ready. Any advice is welcomed! 

For a little background on us: we're both in our mid-20s and live in an apartment located in a two-family home. There's no yard sadly, but we live in a great neighborhood to walk and approximately 15 minutes away from a park. 

**Introduction**

1. *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have  owning/training dogs?*   
I've personally never owned a dog before, but have dog-sat for neighbors and family members for as long as a week. My SO grew up with two Goldendoodles, and we will sometimes have his parents' dogs over in our apartment for a week at a time when they travel.  
2. *Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a* [*reputable breeder*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*?*   
We have no preference, but have been given a lot of recommendations for rescue shelters in our area. 
3. *Describe your ideal dog.*  
A medium-kinda large dog that is not a huge barker. Couch potato at times, not super stubborn, easy to train, affectionate/friendly. Companion-type.
4. *What  breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*   
I do not have a strong personal preference, but my SO really loves dogs like the Goldendoodles he grew up with - big babies, super affectionate and kind. He also prefers dogs that aren't small and tiny. We are open to any breed, however, as long as the shedding isn't overwhelming.
5. *What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*   
Basic obedience. Nothing too crazy!
6. *Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience,  rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?*   
No.

**Care Commitments**

7) *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*   
1 - 2 hours. I work from home so I can play and be present with the dog throughout the day.

8)  *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*   
I would be available to walk the dog for around 45 minutes to an hour, once or twice per day. On weekends, we can walk the dog longer together by going through the park. There's also two dog parks about 20-30 minutes away from us that we can consider going to, but we have yet to visit and check them out. 

9)  *How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to  trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not,  would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*   
I'm open to learning how to do basic maintenance if needed, but for grooming, we are willing to pay a professional.  


**Personal Preferences**

10) *What size dog are you looking for?*   
Medium to slightly large. 60-70ish pounds.

11) *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*   
We would prefer not a lot of barking since we are close to neighbors. Excessive shedding would be a no-go, so just anything not outside of ordinary. Average slobber is okay. 

12) *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*   
Not important at all since we do not have a yard or daily access to an off-leash unfenced area.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*   
In the middle. Willing to snuggle when we're relaxing on the couch and when I'm working, but can also independently play and relax in their own space at times.

14)  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs  more eager-to-please?*   
In the middle, leaning more towards eager-to-please so they are obedient.

15) *How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or  entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or  visitors?* Friendly, but willing to be a guarded, for instance, if someone is trying to break in.

16) *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*   
That's not ideal since we will likely have to dog-sit my SO's parents' senior Goldendoodle occasionally. The Goldendoodle is very kind and laid back, and is good with other dogs.

17) *Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?*   
Destructive chewing (willing to get toys to curb that behavior, though!)

**Lifestyle**

18)  *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*   
Not frequently. I work from home so I will be home for most of, if not all, the day. We may go out for a a little bit on a weekend, so the top max would be five hours. We live next to family friends who are willing to watch the dog if needed, especially if they're younger. 

19) *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*   
My SO and I live together so we will have equal involvement. He volunteered to do most of the training and will teach me as well, since I've never trained a dog before. We would have equal responsibilities, and I will likely spend a majority of time with the dog since I work from home. 

20) *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?*   
Not at the moment or near future that we know of. Likely no. 

21) *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*   
Not regularly. The only situation I could see if my nephews ever visit (ages 3-7 years old). So I would prefer if the dog can tolerable/be friendly with younger, respectful children. 

22)  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or  weight restrictions are on your current lease?*   
There are no restrictions at our current apartment (leased to us by a family member). 

23)  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*  
Queens, NY. I am not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.

24) *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*  
East coast weather so..  
Summer: 85 degrees/ 65 degrees  
Winter: 40 degrees/ 25 degrees  


**Additional Information and Questions**

25) *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.*  
Our apartment isn't the largest (two rooms - one bigger living area and a bedroom). We are aware that isn't the most ideal for larger dogs, but we are super willing to take them on longer or frequent walks. We are overall looking for a companion to bring along with us to places, to give lots of love, and hang out with us - whether it's weekend walks around the area or chilling on the couch while we watch TV at the end of the day. 

We occasionally have friends over (like once or twice a month at most), and our family friends who live next to us are over almost every day for dinner or just to visit. We are mostly a laid back household.

197,dogs,"\*\*Introduction\*\*  1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* This will be my second dog. I currently have an adult retriever mix who I've done some training with and taken a class. He's well behaved and good with other dogs but we're still working on some things.  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \* My current dog is a rescue and I'll definitely rescue again but for my next dog I'd prefer a well-bred puppy or (even better) a retired show dog or rehomed well-bred adult. 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Friendly with people, children, strangers, and other dogs; intelligent, trainable, and handler-focused; confident, not neurotic and not overly sensitive. Preferably sweet, outgoing, and would play well with other dogs. Athletic, highish energy, and healthy (not prone to genetic/structural issues).  4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* I feel most drawn to herding breeds because I want an athletic, intelligent, trainable dog with lower prey drive (would like to get chickens at some point). I know certain breeds tend to be more sensitive though and I don't love that, plus some herding dogs can have neurotic or compulsive personalities which I'd like to avoid. I've considered Aussies (not working line) and smooth collies most seriously. Have also considered some bird dogs but don't want to deal with prey drive. I've also thought about a keeshond, they seem like great dogs though I don't love their long coats, but I've never actually met one.  5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* Basic obedience and manners plus maybe sports/trick training depending on the dog, I don't have a specific job I need the dog to do.  6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \* I'm interested in getting involved with agility with my current dog and potentially future dogs, but I don't have any experience with it. I do canicross with my current dog and would like to continue with future dogs.  \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \* Between my partner &amp; I, we can commit several hours to training and exercise, plus we are generally interacting with the dog most of the time we're at home.  8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \* 1-2 hours of walks/runs per day,    and at the point when I'd be ready to bring home this dog I hope to have a fenced yard. Current dog would love a playmate so they would also hopefully get plenty of exercise from playing together. 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* Find with regular home grooming (teeth, ears, feet, etc.) but don't want a dog with significant grooming requirements (e.g. don't want poodles/hair coated dogs).  \*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  10)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Preferably 30-60 pounds, wouldn't want to go smaller than 20 or much larger than 70.  11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* Shedding isn't a huge issue, don't love barking but I can handle it although I definitely wouldn't mind a dog that doesn't bark a lot or can be trained not to. Would prefer a dog that doesn't slobber.  12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* It's not crucial but I would like a dog I can trust off-leash and would like to train a strong recall.  \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Prefer snuggly :)  14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  \* More eager to please, don't mind some independence but I like trainable dogs.  15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Would prefer a dog to be friendly to strangers and visitors. God I would love a dog that just ignored door knocks and seeing people through windows but I know that's not very likely lol so I'm fine with a dog alert barking.  16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No, I want a dog I can do things with and that would be a good playmate for my current dog.  17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  \* I know this is probably more of an individual thing than a breed thing but I'd like to avoid dogs prone to separation anxiety.  \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* Not super sure - currently both my partner and I are in hybrid/flexible jobs but we would have different jobs at the point when we'd be getting a new dog so we might both be full-time in person. At a minimum I would think one of us would be able to come home during lunch break, so 4-5 hours at a time. Preferably one or both of us would be from home part time though.  19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* My partner would not be as involved with the dog and would prefer a friendly, nice, well adjusted dog. Beyond that I think it's more up to me as I'm more involved.  20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* Yes, 1 friendly mixed breed dog. Would also like to get chickens eventually.  21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \* Yes, my partner and I would be planning to have kids probably within 3-5 years of getting the dog, plus we have relatives with children.  22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \* I think by the time we'd be getting this dog we plan to own a house. If not, we'd be looking to rent a place without dog restrictions.  23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \* USA, no breed laws that I'm aware of in the area we live.  24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \* We're in the upper midwest so summers are humid &amp; 80-90F, sometimes hotter, while winters tend to be 10-30F but sometimes MUCH colder. I'd like a dog that does fine in the warm summer weather (longer walks/runs would be early morning or later evening) and can play outside in the winter on all but the coldest days, would be okay dressing a dog in warm clothes if need be. \*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  \* I'm not looking to get another dog right now, this would be at least a year+ in the future, just looking to get some thoughts on what breeds to look into and then maybe get in touch with some breeders. I know all these requirements are difficult or impossible to meet with a single dog breed, just sharing my preferences. These are NOT all hard and fast, I'm more so looking to get some suggestions of breeds that might align with a decent amount or most of my preferences!   26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",Looking for some suggestions of breeds to look into for my next dog,1673896411,7765,67,1397,13
198,dogs,"A few weeks ago someone spotted a neighbor putting his large dogs in carriers in the back of his work pickup truck.  The carriers look too small for these dogs and the carriers were not secured in the back of the pickup truck.  Also it was around 32 degrees at the time.

Our issue lies with her digestive tract. Ever since she was a pup she has had a sensitive stomach. We shelled out a lot of money to keep her on vet approved Hills ID sensitive stomach dog food. This worked... Okay. Still had issues with vomiting and diarrhea. We have since been on a different sensitive stomach food which I'm not really sure is any better. We always follow the vets advice on how to slowly introduce new food.

We have tried multiple vet visits and to various vets to try and gather an idea on what could potentially be going on. There have been multiple drugs given (probiotics, antibiotics, steroids, you name it, I'm pretty sure we've tried it.) The only drug that our vet hasn't given is an anti anxiety med. 

It's to the point that every day I come home from work there is a kennel completely full of vomit, diarrhea, or a combination of both. She can't go more than a couple hours in the kennel without having an accident. BUT, If I work from home and spend all day next to her the issue is never seen.

I would just like to have a safe space to pour my frustrations with my aunt and the adoption. Again I do not own it.

First of all, they. are. not. fit. for. it. My aunt doesn‚Äôt wanna touch it. Dog‚Äôs fenced. Now why would they get a dog? Literally because their 6 yr old son wanted. Can the son take of it? No. Can they? Meh. They know nothing about dogs except for the fact that they look cute and making it their accessory. Also, it‚Äôs just the dog‚Äôs day 2 here but they let it shit and sleep at the same fucking space. Did they even wipe its butt? Idk. The same people bought 4 birds. Yep. For what? Idk. They don‚Äôt even clean the bird‚Äôs cage. Fucking birdpoop nestling there istg.

Second, the dog is a cuddle dog. The (real) owner had it used to being cuddled which was a bad move for them but it is what it is. They accepted it regardless but they just fenced it. Mind you it‚Äôs just mos old so it‚Äôs supposed to be very clingy, now it‚Äôs crying and just so helpless. I have kittens too they‚Äôre fairly different from pups but they also require attention. I‚Äôd go pet it if I can but I cannot carry since my mom doesn‚Äôt wanna see me around the dog because they think rabies is innate. Ik stupid.

Third, I‚Äôm just a very concerned fellow pet owner. They are sleeping soundly at their room while the dog is whining and crying for over an hour now. I do not get how they can sleep soundly at night. Wtf just wtf. I‚Äôm frustrated rn because I don‚Äôt think this is gonna have a good ending if they don‚Äôt rehome/return it.

It shouldn't be up to some random individual to make up their own rules. 

Some adoption forms are literally over a dozen pages long. Some demands I've seen include unemployed or work from home, no apartments/condos, large fenced yard required, home inspection, three professional references (I'm a firefighter/EMT and I only needed two), must meet everyone in the family, background checks, etc. I talked with one person who said it wasn't that much harder to adopt a child than it was to adopt their dog.

But I am returning to my substantive position that while will still be at home 3 days a week, there may be occasional days where I will be gone for the standard 8 hour work day in the field (I'm a biologist) where I can't just slip home at lunch (because if I was in the office I'd just come home at lunch).  Anything past 8 hours shouldn't be a problem as I have roommates that would be able to let the dog out to self exercise in the yard.

Currently I think the max amount of time I've left my dog has been 5-6 hours and she seems to have been fine. No matter how long I've been gone for I always seem to find her napping on the couch when I return.  Sometimes will play with her toys, but honestly I find that she plays with her toys more when I'm around working from home than when she's home alone.  It's been probably 6-7 months since her last accident in the house so I think she can hold her bladder a full 8 hours.  At night she regularly can hold her bladder 10-11 hours.

So if you were in my shoes, how would you go about transitioning to getting your dog comfortable to being gone for a full 8 hour day?  Should I be not letting the dog out for 8 hours whenever I am working from home? Obviously some exercise (mental/physical) before leaving will be essential on those days. She adapted very well to being left alone in the first place so I'm not too concerned but do want it to go as smoothly as possible (with only minimal destruction targeted at reusable shopping bags lol).  Before people ask, day care is not an option as my female is intact and I don't intend to spay until at minimum 2 years old (and I don't care for those mosh pits in the first place).  I do have some neighbors that I think would be receptive to letting the dog out if I asked but they also have their own lives to live so can't rely on them every time.

249,dogs,"Hi All, so I live alongside a populated river bank and we often let our dog out to roam alongside it without watching her.

The other evening, she returned from being out and she was clearly sad and a little scared. We looked at her and saw she had cuts on her face (nose, under snout, cheek). It looks like a possible bite on one spot, but definitely scratches from something.

She often barks/chases a Fox and a Groundhog while out there. I‚Äôve seen her closely interact with the groundhog before and the groundhog did stop and try to defend itself from her (our dog just continued to bark and never attacked, the groundhog was preparing to defend itself though). I‚Äôve seen her chase the Fox from hole to hole but I‚Äôve never seen our sign stop and interact with the Fox.

She is not an aggressive dog and when she barks at them, it‚Äôs a playful bark..my point is I don‚Äôt think she was trying to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù or attack them, but definitely annoys the hell out of them chasing/barking to the point where they think she‚Äôs a predator. 

With all that said, attached here is a pic of the only truly visible wound. The rest are shallow cuts that you can barely see in a pic, but this one in particular looks deep and might be a bite.

Do we need to take her to a vet to get this looked at? She has her rabies/other shots and she is acting totally fine (this happened last night).

My dog is high energy, playful, almost 2 yo and is super interested in other dogs actually but when the greetings are done he doesn't care anymore. Sometimes when he really gets along with a dog he can play a bit with them for a few minutes and then will get bored.

It's surprising as I have a hard time teaching him that he shouldn't greet every dog we see during walks. He's always very excited to meet a new dog.

I have Japanese spitz, 6 years old, male.
He did go through traumatic experience 2 years ago, when I and my partner moved countries, where he was left in my dad‚Äôs care for 6months. 

Anyways he recently started to show really weird signs of fear? 
He usually is very timid and fearful of strangers or strange objects. For example if his super tasty treat was near one of my plants or guitar, he would never take it. I did train him rigorously, and he is super well behaved. I might have made mistake, because sometimes he feels too behaved.

When I give him one of those treats, his head goes down, like human would react if someone were to hit them. His eyes start blinking a lot. This mostly happens with stick-like treats, and some small treats that have real strong smell. 

I tried petting him in various ways on his head, he does not react as so. I also tried with different types of treats, and all normal smell small treats are fine, and stuff like meat, sosauges and salami are fine too. 

I brush his teeth every morning, and investigated his teeth, and they are fine. 

For his whole life he has blinked on one of the eyes a bit more, and also ‚Äúcried‚Äù on that eyes, which we treated with vet prescribed eye drops. The tears stopped, but his blinking ever continued so. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs impossible that he is abused, as I work from home, and we are together constantly. The only part when he was with someone I don‚Äôt have full confidence in was when he was travelling by van from my country to the one I currently am. The trip took 3 days.

273,dogs,"I've been working on some basic obedience commands with my about 6-month-old rescue pup. So far he knows how to sit, and how to give paw and he does these pretty consistently when he's near me - I train these randomly.   


He understands the come command but I made the mistake to release him from the leash early and I almost poisoned the cue when I got him last month (on about week 2 after I got him). I started at home with come and sit and transitioned to going out of town to a field where I ended up screaming come a lot before realizing this was teaching him he can ignore me. This went on for a few days so I don't think I managed to poison it. Since then I've stopped using the word come, and I've obtained a 10m long line for training. We go out only with the long line now and he's getting better at coming consistently although we still have a long way to go.  


What I'm confused about is how to mix the heel command into the training. I live in a big city so the long line is all in my hand and I keep him close until we get to a safe green area where I can let go of the line. He tries to walk in front of me and I pull him to my side but I feel like he's getting confused. At one point I let him go far away and at another, I keep pulling him to my side - I don't think he understands why I keep pulling him. I had like 3 days last week where we were doing heel only but I feel like trying to train heel and come together just doesn't mix and he gets confused. The thing is we really need both of these to be able to commute through the city.  


How would you guys go about this? Should I train them separately? How would that look?  
Also isn't the long line counter-intuitive to heel training? He gets the impression he can be far away when we train to come and then I keep pulling him to my side on the walk back. (I reward with treats when he walks by my side)

This Pomeranian is so loved by her I‚Äôm pretty sure he is ranked higher than myself and our kids (kinda kidding). He had a brother (Greyhound) who he lived with for 7 years and they were inseparably until the Greyhound passed, even though everyone said that was a bad idea. A while later we got a Mastiff-Shepherd mix puppy, she is 2 now. Until now, there has not been the slightest sign of aggression from the Mastiff other than a little growling over food, but that is usually instigated by the pom wandering over to steal food since he was a food addict.

A few nights ago, both dogs were playing in the front room, bouncing back and forth at each other. My wife witnessed this and saw a switch just flip and the mastiff went hair-up, lunged, and picked up the Pom and shook him. My wife had to pry her mouth open.

We rushed the Pom to the vet and he had 4 broken ribs and a collapsed lung. The cost would have been upwards of $9k for surgery. I told my wife we‚Äôd pay it but after more thought we realized the chances of him surviving were not great and he‚Äôd never be the same. So we had him euthanized.

Now, we are left with our Mastiff who until now has been a big baby. She is so gentle with our young kids, other people, and generally good with other dogs but admittedly hasn‚Äôt been well socialized. She really is a sweetheart who made a horrible choice, one I chalk up to animal instincts (maybe the Pom was sick and weak and she sensed it, maybe she was simply playing and got too rough).

Regardless, my wife (especially) is devastated. Her baby is dead and our Mastiff murdered him. She has tried to be around the mastiff once but is traumatized by what she witnessed and what happened and says she has no love left for our other dog. 

We really only have 2 choices: humanely euthanized her, or keep her and pay very close attention. I am 50-50. I know she is a great dog, she‚Äôs so gentle with everyone it just makes no sense.

i feel like an animal abuser even letting her be alive this long because she should have been put to sleep the second she started displaying ‚Äòdog dementia‚Äô behaviors in my opinion. but i‚Äôm just a kid and my mom won‚Äôt listen to me. she keeps coming up with excuses as to why to not do it. my dad recently died so first it was ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt want to deal with more death‚Äù, then it was ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt want to put the dog to sleep because christmas was coming up‚Äù, and now it was ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt want to put her to sleep right in the new year‚Äù 

to be honest the dog should have been put to sleep WEEKS and WEEKS and WEEKS ago, but no one listens to me. everyone from my dumbass aunt to my stupid brother (who doesn‚Äôt even live with us anymore so how would they know) keeps saying ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs fine‚Äù and ‚Äúi wouldn‚Äôt do it‚Äù and my brother even went as far as calling my mother ‚Äúselfish‚Äù for even thinking about putting her to sleep. sorry this is kind of turning into a rant but this dog is making my existence miserable since i‚Äôm the one stuck at home with her all day every day. it‚Äôs making me resent the dog and yell at her, even though she doesn‚Äôt even understand, when the dog used to be my best friend. it‚Äôs also making me more irritable in general, and more hostile towards my mother for letting it go on this long. please help

I have something of an odd question- I have a knack for finding dogs for people that meet all of their specifications (training, price, breed, age, etc). Examples include: 

1. A free, trained Pomsky with two different colored eyes within 6 hours of home (found in 20 minutes)

2. A trained adult female miniature schnauzer under 10 pounds within 3 hours of home for under $600 (found in an hour and negotiated price before passing information on to interested party).

I have been considering doing this as a side gig, and just charging $30-50 only if someone adopts or buys a dog I give them the information for as a finder‚Äôs fee, but I‚Äôm not sure if there would be a market for this.

292,dogs,"I'm a first-time dog owner with a 7 year old terrier that I've had since he was 1 year old, and I constantly fear that I'm not giving him his best life. 

The thing is, I live in a city apartment, which means that there's no backyard to easily give him outside time, and I struggle with severe anxiety, so going outside is really difficult for me. I try take him on at least two 15-30 minute walks a day, and I go on weekly 3-4 hr outings on a hike or the dog park when it's not raining, but I can't stop thinking about how much happier he'd be if he was in a home that had a big backyard he could run around in, unleashed every day. 

I work from home because I don't want to leave him alone all day, but then I end up seeing how he sits in his bed all day not doing anything, and I feel terrible. I've tried a lot of mental enrichment things like hiding treats in rolled up rags or getting Kong toys and slow feeder bowls, but these things only last an hour at most. And then there's my anxiety, which keeps me in my bedroom with the door shut all day, and I barely even venture out into the living room except when I'm on my way out for walks. He sticks by my side all day, so I just feel awful that he's spending so much of his life confined to one small room. 

For food, he eats kibbles supplemented with boiled meats, eggs, probiotics, and other add-ons, and I shower him with treats (and affection), but then I see other dogs eating raw, fully home-cooked diets, and I don't know if that's what I'm supposed to be doing or if that carries health risks. And then I just get sad that he eats the same thing every day. 

I dunno. Am I overthinking this? I'm trying my best, but I don't have anything to compare my level of care to. And he's healthy, but seeing him lie around all day while I'm busy makes me worry that he's miserable and confined. I would appreciate any insight you might have.

300,dogs,"I‚Äôll start by saying our dog is about 8yo, but he still has a lot of energy. He‚Äôs an English toy terrier, and isn‚Äôt a fan of new dogs. The few dogs he knows, he absolutely loves to play with them. 

He has always been a bit rough because we didn‚Äôt know anyone else with friendly dogs when we got him, and he only got a couple of positive socialisation experiences when he was young (he got attacked buy an off leash dog a couple of times), and now struggles with anxiety which has lead to aggression in the past (mostly just defensive nips or snapping). He usually only does it when he feels cornered. 

Since we got the puppy (female whippet) 3 weeks ago, it initially took a couple days for him to get use to her, but they‚Äôve otherwise been playing quite well together. 

They play rough, but neither are showing signs of aggression (they keep going back for more, chase back and fourth, take turns on their back with their stomachs exposed, etc), even if they both sometimes get overexcited. 

Older dog resource guards food, and might snap at her when she approaches while he has a high value treat, but she also tries to steal it out his mouth, so I‚Äôve been letting him tell her off when she tries to steal treats, and feed them meals separated. 

Yesterday, he bit her. They were playing, I‚Äôm assuming she did something to hurt him accidentally, and he yelped. Usually he just backs off, but this time he pinned her down and wouldn‚Äôt back off when she yelped. 

We separated them and once they were calm again, gave them a treat to keep them occupied. 

My mother in law watched them today while we were at work, and puppy came home with a cut on her lip. Apparently a similar thing happened. He bit her while they were playing, but wouldn‚Äôt back her off when she cried out. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do, or why he‚Äôs suddenly snapping during playtime. 

We‚Äôre going to closely observe their play, and immediately separate them if it happens again, or gets too intense. I don‚Äôt want this to negatively affect either of them, but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to traumatise her. 

What options do I have from here? Is there anything else we can do?

We‚Äôve been looking into obedience training with him, and also extra socialisation. He‚Äôs usually very tolerant of her puppy behaviours outside of these instances.

Dog and puppy have been playing fine (albeit rough) until yesterday when dog bit the puppy during play. He didn‚Äôt back off when she yelped. He did the same thing today.

The backstory here is that I am in my last year of university and got this puppy fully knowing it would be a lot of work. She gets a lot of exercises (runs in the forest with other dogs 4x a week, daily hour-long leash walks, constant playing and enrichment activities/ kongs/ toys. She will not go to sleep on her own so I have to crate her to nap or she gets insanely aggressive. I did 6-week puppy training, and hired a private dog trainer and did four 1.5 hr home sessions with her. She's also never alone in her crate for more than 3-4 hours at a time, max 2 times a week.

I can't be comfortable in my own home as I'm starting to get scared of her now that she's bigger. I can't have people over because she attacks them. On leash walks, they always end with her lunging at my legs and biting so hard to the point of breaking the skin.    


I'm just so sad. I've put endless time, energy, and money into her, to the point of failing a class to stay home with her more to train her. I've gotten her checked by a vet for any issues, and done training, and I'm just lost and so sad and so broken on what to do. I love her but I don't know what to do anymore I'm feeling like this dog needs a serious behavioural specialist and am wondering if I'm the right owner match for her because I feel like I'm failing.

303,dogs,"TL;DR: Looking for advice on how to legally take a dog away from a person obsessed over the looks but is neglecting and malnourishing her own dog

Hello everyone, first of all I‚Äôm sorry about the bad grammar

I‚Äôm looking for advice in regards to a Golden R. where me and my mother have been in a tough situation where we don‚Äôt know how to deal with my aunt‚Äôs (her sister) cruelty towards people and the dogs but at the same time obsession over the one dog she‚Äôs neglecting. I‚Äôm always working, however I‚Äôd cut my hours for this dog, just advice me on how to legally take her away after I explain the following.

First, our situation. I‚Äôm living in FL and I‚Äôve been working on myself for the last year getting where I want to be at. Unfortunately for me and my mother, we realized too late the kind of person that her sister is. Before, we were paying rent in a place where we could all stay in 4 rooms separately but since everything has become so expensive and my mother lost her job, we moved to a 2 room apt where we‚Äôre staying in the living room, we‚Äôre trying to save all the money we can but it hasn‚Äôt been great since this person is very rude, argumentative and unsanitary and just a bad aura overall so we are trying to find a place within MY budget to move out ASAP if it‚Äôs even possible. It was cheaper before and even living in my car is better for me however I can‚Äôt drag my mother to this kind of living.

Sorry, I‚Äôm not going to make this short. The Golden Retriever has been with us for almost 4 years now, she has become a malnourished adult, scared of everything, sudden moves, or if you call her she won‚Äôt come because she thinks she‚Äôs getting beaten, this person doesn‚Äôt know any other psychological methods other than beat her up to correct her about something. All she eats is dog food that she doesn‚Äôt like (she‚Äôs picky), sometimes she leaves it untouched and this phenomenon doesn‚Äôt care if she ate for the day, for the night or if she ate at all since the other 2 dogs eat anything that gets on any of all 3 separate sets of bowls. She refuses to try anything different. Sometimes, this person mixes boiled turkey ground meat or chicken with her food, forces her to eat it or she won‚Äôt let her go anywhere because ‚Äúit costs her money‚Äù, the other dogs either eat her food and just eat anything that reaches their mouth, including dirty toilet paper, shoes or furniture.

She has been with these 2 smaller untrained dogs that would bark at grass moving if they were able to go out and see the outside world, they go out at least once every 2 weeks but ONLY for 5 minutes MAX. They have to be taken out separately. One of the small dogs is smart enough to have gotten so overweight she suffocates. All 3 together is uncontrollable, the smaller dogs look and sound as if they‚Äôre going to kill anything that moves. She has being copycat‚Äôing everything they do. Barks at people from far but is friendly when they‚Äôre close to her, uncontrollable on leash because she wants to run or senses some kind of urgency to do everything before she gets thrown back into the house, can‚Äôt see another dog because she gets over excited. Plays with cloth toys that haven‚Äôt been washed since day 1 and it‚Äôs surprising to me that she‚Äôs not sick yet. She‚Äôs apparently trained by this person to jump on people, table, kitchen counters, anything. Seating, laying down, even opening a door she has learned with me.

I don‚Äôt know her exact weight but all she has is hair, you can feel her bones under the 764 coats of hair she has (since born), there‚Äôs hair everywhere in the house and clothes (balls of hair) this person doesn‚Äôt clean the house at all (I try to keep the kitchen clean at all times and the living room). This person didn‚Äôt even know what grooming was until I showed it to her on YouTube, she thought that you are only meant to cut the dog‚Äôs hair but she says that the Golden R. ‚Äúlooks‚Äù so beautiful with all that hair that she doesn‚Äôt do anything for her to this day, she only loves the dog because of the looks. However the other 2 smaller dogs get their full service and even a bow tie, the other smaller dog that is not overweight looks like a rat because of how skinny he is but she thinks that the haircut, hairy face and a bow tie looks perfect.

All of them get washed once every 4-6 months. Exactly, not a technicality. The skinny small dog with a bow tie was gray and he‚Äôs white. You need to keep telling her to do so or do it yourself. Their teeth are deformed from eating furniture, black gums and dirty teeth however she says that the vet says that they‚Äôre super healthy.

This person refuses to do anything for her and just says ‚Äúyea, I‚Äôll do it tomorrow‚Äù. I‚Äôm the only one that does any of the above when I get home or if I go home at all. I‚Äôd take full responsibility to take care of the Golden R. and would even give her my plate of food the day that I can‚Äôt afford my own. However, she keeps the dogs locked in her room under her bed and doesn‚Äôt want anyone to take them out or give them any food that isn‚Äôt what she wants to give them in such small portions that is unbelievable to me.

I‚Äôm highly considering looking more into becoming a vet tech - as of right now it‚Äôs just a thought, no real plans made. It‚Äôs been an off and on thought for a while.

However, I‚Äôm not really interested in a full time job at a clinic setting. 

I don‚Äôt know how to explain this so I‚Äôll just tell my backstory: one of my dogs has *significant* vet aversion, im trying to get in a ‚Äòclass‚Äô for dogs with vet aversion (basically helping desensitize them) at the only veterinary behaviorist that‚Äôs local to me, it‚Äôs just really full so I don‚Äôt know when I can get in. (Btw I‚Äôm not asking for advice on this but if you want to give advice that‚Äôs fine. I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything I can with medication protocols, happy visits, cooperative care at home, and trying to get into this class/ program). But anyway, so *I mention this to provide back story on why I‚Äôm passionate / motivated personally*

I‚Äôve become really interested in‚Ä¶ all things dogs‚Ä¶ I even took the KPA course and I‚Äôm a KPA-CTP and I don‚Äôt train dogs now, I‚Äôm not a dog trainer now. I just did it for fun as my ‚Äòfoundation‚Äô so to speak. So again: passionate and motivated. 


Goes without saying: being a licensed vet tech requires regular practice (ie: a job). However‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt really feel like being a vet tech at a clinic full time. I could definitely see myself being part time though, just not full time. 

But anyway, so that‚Äôs kind of the main thing that has stopped me because I don‚Äôt know what *else* there is to do as a licensed vet tech that‚Äôs not being a vet tech at a vet clinic. 

For example: I know at my vet behaviorist, they have a licensed vet tech who does a lot of the hands on training for desensitization etc. so that‚Äôs one thing/ idea in addition to working in a clinic. 

But is there anything else on the realm of: vet care + fear free + training that kind of‚Ä¶ rings a bell anywhere? 

I‚Äôd like to note: This is something I‚Äôm passionate about not just for my dog, but dogs in general especially. Of course my main motivation is coming from my own dog to learn as much as I can for my dog and my future dogs, but I‚Äôm passionate about this for all dogs.",What type of jobs can a vet tech have that‚Äôs not working in a typical clinic / ER setting?

I tapped (once) my dogs anal glands because my mom said it doesn't hurt them if you touch it.  She did it to my other dog we had to see how it felt. My dogs tail moved a little and she seemed OK, then I patted her firmly like, ""Ah you're fine."" Then she raised her head with alertness, like ""WTF?"" I think she was startled more by the patting than anything.  

I guess I feel terrible about this and have no idea what possessed me to do that, other than the fact my own judgement was clouded.  I feel like I violated her, but she seemed okay with me ever since and I made sure to treat gently.  About a half a year ago, she scooted her butt into me, so I'm sure she moved past it.

324,dogs,"I got Leo, a 2 year old Border Collie and Corgi mix who was absolutely so beautiful. My parents and I have never had pets and as a adult child, but I've been wanting one for a long time but knew that I couldn't get one until I got my own place or if I could convince my parents to be open to the idea of one for the home. 

They were apprehensive to the idea of getting one but they decided to give a shot by at least trying out my first time going to the store to take a rescue dog on a walk. We all instantly really liked him and decided by the next day to take him home which looking back, we made a mistake in not realizing the traits about his breed which led to some of the things that were misbalanced with our lifestyles. 

He is very well behaved and so playful and intelligent in a crazy way and learned literally new words and commands everyday even though we were new to each other. 

I spent a lot of time with him pretty much all day all week since my mom and dad were busy with their own work working remotely at home. It was hard to study and work but I have much more free time now and I just pretty much tried to do my best with him. A walk in the morning and the night. He was so hard initially to walk and all over the place but so quickly he came to be by my side. I had the patience to take a journey with him but I was getting stressed since even play in the backyard twice a day as well was not enough to appease his restless nature as he started to chew on furniture and the carpet, which I didn't know how to stop. 

There were sort of other ""harmless"" things like peeing on the carpet, jumping and play-biting strangers, or him getting aggressive if he was bored. 

My parents and I feel so stupid since we were in this spot where we got him cause we liked so much but didn't do research on Border Collie's and as first time pet owners too and with other circumstances that seemed to really make the next few months seem like it would be stressful or difficult mostly for my parents especially if I moved out of the home. I wanted him ultimately and my parents came along for it with my mom completely switching around after loving him so much too. My dad was leaning to return him by the middle of the week and the tension seemed like it couldn't work if all of us couldn't 100% want him and the commitment to keep him happy. 

I felt so tired too throughout the day after having to be by his side all day or on his own, he seemed to have bad separation anxiety that would lead to potentially destructive behavior with objects, walls, or stuff in the home if left on his own. 

We clearly didn't know what to do. Training seemed best but then even if he was well behaved, I worried if his energy levels were too much for me to handle and if I could really commit to this while needing time to focus on my career. 

I wanted to keep him by my heart but it was heartbreaking since it looked like it seemed more logical for the health of Leo to have a home better suited to keeping him more occupied than maybe we would not have been able to provide for various reasons. I don't know if training would've helped with his behavior to the point that we could stimulate him indoors or outdoors with a little more advanced games to keep him happy with less time. I then thought about how if I moved away and was unable to bring him with me which seemed like the case, my parents and their health conditions and aging might not mean Leo could get what he needs with exercise. 

Finally I decided that it was tough but rather than keeping Leo longer, it would be better for his health to go back sooner. I feel bad since he learned new things everyday and seemed to be getting better to understand. I've never felt such a bond with another animal like this. He had so much of a personality I was just starting to get. I feel like I betrayed him and that he's sad now and confused why I'm gone. 

I try to hope he will end up fine but it just feels so unfortunate this happened this way. I want to imagine this future where we were able to live with him or if even before that, if we were smart enough to do research on breeds and the best fit for our home and lifestyles. My dad definitely doesn't want a dog again and my mom is very heartbroken tonight. I am looking forward to the day I have my own place to find a dog I can give love to and share that relationship with. 

Leo spent a week in my life but taught me so much about life, love, and so much more I can't believe I've never going to see him again.

326,dogs,"So recently my dog (15, female, shih tzu/chihuahua mix) moved in with me at a new place, but she has stayed here several times before and never acted like this. 

As soon as I get into the bed she starts panting and shaking. She's an extremely quiet dog, so this is the closest she gets to crying. She is normally not particularly affectionate and doesn't like to be held, but while she is upset like this, she will lay in my arms without trying to get away, like she normally would. 

I've tried turning the heating up, turning the heating off, opening the window, leaving the lights on, feeding her, taking her outside, petting her, talking to her, playing calming music for her, holding her, bringing her blanket and toys, giving her treats, and so on. The only thing that calms her is to sleep in the living room on the sofa with her. From this, I gather that it's not me sleeping that is the issue but the room.

She also doesn't settle down if I bring her into the room during the day. She was okay for the first few days I brought her here and then started acting like this. I have slept on the sofa with her every night for the past week, and she sleeps just fine there.

She doesn't like to be apart from me so if I shut her out of the room or try to get her to sleep in the living room alone, she will just follow me to my room or scratch at the door until I bring her back into my room, only for her to start panting and shaking again. 

As far as I know I haven't made changes to the room or introduced anything new. Her behaviour is completely unchanged when in any other situation. I have touched all over her and applied pressure and gently pulled on her etc. to see if she has any pain response, but she doesn't seem to be in any obvious discomfort.

I tried crate training him as a puppy but as he‚Äôs a big dog he damaged and escaped from 4 crates before I eventually gave up. I cannot do it anymore.

328,dogs,"Hello, I have four dogs of a similar age. A few days ago out of the blue my eldest (3) began to guard one of my other dogs (2). He hasn't done anything like this before and he doesn't generally guard them. I have noticed that he has been following dog (2) around much to dog (2) irritation he also keeps trying to sniff dog (2) backside, we have checked to see if it is something to do with his anal glands  (it isn't)

he's shown very little interest in him before this other than playing together, sleeping together and eating together. He generally gets on well with all of the other dogs but does have behavioural issues, he has anxiety and fear aggression which we have worked with a dog behavioural specialist to un-train certain behaviours and 99% of the time he's good, he responds to commands well and we are well versed in recognizing the warning signs and adjusting his behaviour by re-directing him, for example, if we sense there's a commotion about to start we gently direct him out of the room, we never shout at him as this only increases his stress levels and we never use physical violence because it does nothing to solve the issue other than making him afraid of us.  He had been on anti-anxiety medication for over a year to help keep him calm while we re-trained him. And had been doing extremely well in the last six months that we were able to ween him off it completely.  If I were to describe it would be very skittish around new people and it takes a long time to gain his trust but once trust is established he is extremely loving. 

Rehoming him is not an option nor is rehoming any of our dogs, they are not aggressive but they wouldn't do well apart or with new people, they are used to us, we are their family and they are our family. 

 I just want some advice on what it could be. 

Our eldest dog is not neutered as we were told by the behaviour specialist that this could result in a lack of confidence which would lead to an increase in fear and aggression. 

None of the other dogs is also neutered but this isn't an issue as they tend to get on very well we do not have any female dogs in our house and the closest (a few doors down) is neutered so they wouldn't be able to smell any chemicals she lefts off if she were in heat.",Advice: My dog keeps guarding my other dog.

Usually he liked to wander around the yard sniffing things, etc. When I noticed he hadn't come back in (we have a dog door) I went outside with a flashlight fearing the worst. There he was laying there and I immediately knew he was dead. There were no signs of trauma, no blood, nothing. I have been in shock for the past few days because it was so sudden and he was acting normal and happy just a few  hours before. The only thing I could figure was maybe he had a heart attack. The strange thing about that was about 3 months ago he had some dental work done and they had to put him under, so before they did that they ran blood work and other tests to make sure he was healthy and said that he was completely healthy.

So today I decided to walk around the yard to see if I could find any clues, and right near the back fence was a rat bait station that the hole had been cut with a knife to make it bigger and was empty. After giving it some thought the only way this could have ended up in my yard was if someone threw it  there (I have a 6 ft wooden fence surrounding the yard).

I asked my next door neighbor what he thought and he said that about 3 years ago his cat was  poisoned and he always strongly suspected it was the guy that lives behind us. I asked what made him think it was him and he said when his cat went missing he found it dead in that guys yard and when he retrieved it the guy was on his porch and didn't say anything to him and wouldn't even look at him as he wrapped his dead cat in a towel and took him home.

339,dogs,"Hi!

Cliche story: my boyfriend (36M) has a dog (4YO golden doodle) who is not trained - his problem, NOT hers. I (36F) prefer a dog-free life. I want my relationship to be healthy, I want HER to get the care she needs, and ultimately it‚Äôd be great to bond with her. 

I‚Äôm posting looking for feedback on how I‚Äôm thinking of approaching this. I realize I‚Äôm not a dog lover, dog parent, trainer, and I need to make sure what I want to say is respectful and kind from a perspective I don‚Äôt have. 

The behaviors she has that frustrate me can all be traced back (I think) to how little training and stimulation she‚Äôs been given. 

She pulls on leash. She jumps on people. She whines when she isn‚Äôt being engaged. She licks skin a lot. She barks a lot, often inside during the middle of the night. She scratches furniture, she begs at the table when we eat. All of this, to me, seems like a dog who is just being a dog and is probably under stimulated, under exercised. 

There are some things that frustrate me that are also not her, but him - she‚Äôs allowed to sleep in bed. She isn‚Äôt bathed monthly so after the dog park or being in city streets, she‚Äôs dirtier than I‚Äôm okay with being on my furniture. He does a lot of removing her eye goop and - I am embarrassed to type this because it grosses me out - feeds it to her. 
When she is pulling or barking outside, he picks her up. My guess is that reinforces that her behavior at the very least gets attention. He stays indoors with her from 9pm to 10am. I don‚Äôt have a dog but that seems like a long time for a dog‚Äôs bladder, and for no activity. 

The only exercise she gets is two walks a day, both to the subway to stay at the office. 

So what I know:
She is extremely loving. 
She isn‚Äôt given much chance to exercise or use her mind. 
And I don‚Äôt want to live with a dog. 
The man I‚Äôm dating is open to feedback but I really don‚Äôt want to shame him or make him feel like a bad dog parent just because he isn‚Äôt parenting the way I (assume?) I would. 

I want to present some training ideas to him in a positive way. ‚ÄúI want our relationship to be healthy, I want to be a good caretaker for her. I have some ideas! Can I share?‚Äù

Guys, I worry that ultimately I shouldn‚Äôt date someone with an animal. 

But - I want to try. For him AND her.

340,dogs,"Tl; dr: Is it normal to not be able to pick up a dog from boarding on a Monday because of a holiday? 

Background: This is my friend's dog. I was on vacation last week and I told my friend I'd pick her dog up from boarding when I got back because her trip and my trip overlapped by a day. I got back last night and expected to pick the dog up today but they're closed. Then I just heard they're closed tomorrow too because of the holiday. 

Is this common practice? Seems strange to me that I wouldn't be able to just go pick her dog if someone's there watching them up but I've never been a dog owner so this is new to me. I tried googling for answers but I didn't find any. Just trying to make sure lil dude's ok!

341,dogs,"Dog not acting herself, itching, redness, lethargic


Species: Dog

Age:  4 years

Sex/Neuter status:  Female, spayed

Breed: Rescue, shelter said Pyrenees and Coonhound 

Body weight: 90lbs

History: 
- Addisons disease (managed on Zycortal and Prednisone)
- Elevated liver enzymes (Alk Phos ~5300, was ~3000 in August. On Denamarin, vet blames on Prednisone. Previous US showed smaller than normal liver)
- Sediment in urine ( on Urinary care diet)
*Recent ear infection - Vet said yeast? Treated with 1 week of Mometavet
*Recent skin infection - presented as balding-peeling spot in fur with slight redness, treated with 1 week of GentaVed spray

Clinical signs: Went to the vet last Saturday and got treatment for her ear infection/skin infection. We got her nails clipped while we were there(they‚Äôre brittle and crack when we do). They said her temp was elevated but blamed it on her being so worked up/nervous l. Also got rabies booster and bordatella nasal spray. Started licking paws a lot when we got home, we gave her a bath.  Seemed a little better

A few days ago she started itching more and more. Noticed a few little red spots on her tummy but not super unusual for her. Acting normal for the most part

Last night she started to get very restless. Crying to go in and out of the bedroom. She sleeps under the bed at night, and would crawl under, lay there, then crawl out and start itching. Eventually just stopped crawling under there and laid in spots in the room to try and sleep which is pretty odd for her. Peed and pooped like normal though, ate fine yesterday and drank plenty of water before bed.

This morning she is not acting herself and is pretty lethargic. Her belly is fairly red and warm. She has red spots scattered around her skin, in armpits, etc. Her eyes are bloodshotish and slightly puffy and droopy but she did not sleep nearly at all last night and seems pretty tired. It feels like she may have a swollen spot on her chest? She refused her Denamarin rolled in cheese and turkey this morning, but took her prednisone in a treat. She hasn‚Äôt really eaten or drank anything else yet. She maybe looks swollen in certain places but I can‚Äôt tell for sure?

345,dogs,"Just wanted suggestions on my situation and thought this would be a good place to ask.

I adopted a 5-7yr old (then 3-5) shelter dog during COVID. She is extremely sweet, but was used to breed puppies and kept in a cage before being rescued, so her socialization skills with other dogs are probably minimal and she‚Äôs very reactive. Never aggressive or anything, but anxious energy at times, and if a stranger comes into the house she will bark at them for a solid 5-10mins (especially men). When I leave the house she sits in the same spot on the sofa and does. not. Move until I come home. Isn‚Äôt destructive or agitated but it‚Äôs clear she just doesn‚Äôt know what to do without me being there. 

I worked remote for most of the pandemic and am still hybrid so I‚Äôm home a lot and she is glued to my hip.

I‚Äôve basically been unable to really do anything in the past two years, and it wasn‚Äôt that big of an issue during the pandemic but now I‚Äôm looking at trying to plan the occasional weekend getaway and want to figure out what to do with her that won‚Äôt traumatize her any further. 

I tried a test run at a boarding facility where they had her there for a hands on ‚Äúdaycare‚Äù with constant supervision, and although they said she did OK, I could tell she had a bit of a deer in headlights look when I picked her up, and they told me she had to be placed in a a special area for anxious dogs. So I haven‚Äôt taken her back there again. I thought it would be a good opportunity for her to get some supervised socialization but I think it was too much.

One time I went to a wedding and asked my neighbor if he could let her out while I was gone‚Ä¶ even had him stop by beforehand so she‚Äôd be familiar with him, but she still freaked out when he came over and ran upstairs and hid. So I had to come home early to let her out because he couldn‚Äôt coax her down. After that I never asked anyone to let her out again. I basically just compromise my social life ‚Ä¶ my ex girlfriend even mentioned the dog as a reason for breaking up with me - she said it bothered her that I never stayed over longer and had to always run home to let her out. She felt like I prioritized my dog over our relationship‚Ä¶ which is true and I have no regrets over. But it would definitely be nice to find some middle ground so I can have somewhat of a social life.

I know a lot of people whose parents help them out with their pets but long story short, mine cannot.

We‚Äôve fed him wet food and mix it with kibble and he will just eat the wet food for a couple weeks and now that isn‚Äôt interesting to him. This morning for breakfast we gave him 2 cups of kibble with some bone broth, egg, yogurt, and blueberries. He still didn‚Äôt touch it. He will eat when he‚Äôs hungry but it‚Äôs starting to become an issue. He is about 56lbs and a medium-large size dog (I‚Äôll attach a picture if I can figure out how to). we took him to the vet for his annual check up and she said he‚Äôs underweight and wants to see him at 65lbs. It‚Äôs so stressful because I feel like people think we neglect him or don‚Äôt feed him when he constantly has food in his bowl. We‚Äôve tried it all!

368,dogs,"Our 9 month golden retriever is definitely in his adolescence phase, he‚Äôs not been too badly behaved  but is much more needy/anxious than he used to be- also might be exacerbated by the fact we recently had a baby (10 weeks old) and I think he‚Äôs found it difficult not always having our attention on him. Recently in the evenings he will come and rest his chin on random bits of furniture or on myself or my husband. It seems like he‚Äôs asking for something or perhaps sulking! 

We give him pets when he does this but he‚Äôll often then back away and not want to be touched. We thought he might be asking us for something so we‚Äôll take him outside, offer him a toy to play with, encourage him to eat his kibble (an annoying teenage phase is him going off of all kibble we offer him, but more than happy to eat treats and beg for food when we‚Äôre eating)

Just wondering what this behaviour indicates? I thought it might be boredom/he wants attention but when we offer him these things he doesn‚Äôt seem interested!

He's an amazing 5yo dog. Very sweet, very loving, and just wants people to love him. I adopted him the day I met him. I know the first few days are the hardest and committed to getting him the training he needs. I know that rescues are challenging. He has separation anxiety and has shown some signs of aggression, but I already have training scheduled and am trying to do everything right.

But I wasn't prepared for how actually having him would impact my mental health in ways not intended. I have been planning to get a dog for many years now but held off due to struggling to manage my mental illness. I didn't think it would be fair to have an animal who needs me to care for them when I couldn't care for myself. I thought I had reached a point where I could balance the needs of an animal and my own but a few days in and I feel like I can't do it.

I was abused growing up and developed a perfectionism problem because of that. Anything not fitting into what I think should be ""perfect"" sends my anxiety through the roof.

\- On my days off I am usually doing many activities from hiking a nature trail to going to the beach. There are days I stay home and just be a lazy. With that being said, preferably a breed that is on the ready when I am but can be lazy when I am.

\- I am a bit OCD so short coat or low shedding is a big plus.

\- This is not my first dog, I do have experience mainly with smaller dogs.

\- My size preference is 15 to 40 LBS. I would say small to medium.

\- Intelligence is a 50/50 for me. I would like a dog that can learn commands but if there presents a minor stubborn streak then that‚Äôs okay too.

\- A couple breeds I have been looking into is Chihuahua, Rat Terrier, Min Pin, Italian Greyhound, Whippet, and Mini Schnauzer. Dachshund was on my list but due to the excessive barking (scent hounds) and over 60% chance of IVDD, they were removed.

My pup is part poodle, which probably feeds into the alert barking. He is a 22lb cavalier/poodle mix, 1y 9mo old. This has been going on since he was neutered at 7 months, which is also probably when adolescence started.

We were just at the vet for an exam and I told her how sound sensitive he is. She was like ‚Äúoh like he doesn‚Äôt like fireworks?‚Äù Haha, no. Pretty much any tiny sound can set him off: a voice outside, a car door shutting, my head softly touching the wall when I lean back on the headboard, the sound of setting a glass down on the table, if I accidentally hit my elbow on the wall, the dishwasher, you name it. 

We‚Äôve tried white noise machines and having thunderstorm or rain sounds in the background. Right now the best thing we‚Äôve figured out is calming treats in the morning (zesty paws - mainly melatonin) and keeping him tired from activity. But I‚Äôm not kidding when I say he can go from being in a deep sleep to absolutely losing his mind howling/sputtering/barking in a fraction of a second if he hears the wrong noise.

397,dogs,"Over Christmas (2022) my family went abroad. We boarded our Grand Champion King Charlie‚Äôs Cavalier Charlie as well as our two other dogs for a little over two weeks at Maple Lane Kennels in Ortonville, MI.

We provided them with written, specific instructions explaining how he needed to be fed separately as our other dogs would poach his food. Maple Lanes disregarded these instructions entirely.

When we dropped Charlie off in late December ‚Äò22 he was a happy, healthy, energetic dog. I remember he immediately ran around exploring the kennel when I dropped him off. When we picked him up just a few days after the New Year he was an entirely different dog. His fur was stained yellow, he was 25% lighter, he had no energy, he was unresponsive, and unable to walk.

I had to carry him to the car.

We brought him home, bathed him, (as he was soaked in his own urine and feces), and rushed him to the emergency vet soon after as his condition was not improving. Within 6 hours of picking our boy up, Oakland Veterinary Referral Services (local vet ER in Oakland County, MI) recommended we put him down, as he was in severe pain with no chance of recovering.

The day I picked Charlie up, Fred Saber, the owner of Maple Lanes, told me Charlie had been seen by a Vet the day prior and, ‚Äúwould be fine.‚Äù  We would have taken him to OVRS sooner, but this situation was unthinkable. Unfortunately, it was determined by OVRS that those few hours between pickup from Maple Lanes and taking him to their location would not have mattered. His condition was determined to have been terminal before we picked Charlie up.

Charlie‚Äôs death was entirely preventable. It was caused by the owner Fred Saber and Kelley Saber‚Äôs gross negligence and failure to acknowledge Charlie‚Äôs deteriorating condition as well as gross negligence of the Maple Lane staff. Had they called a Vet, had they taken him to a Vet (as we had authorized), had they called us, had they done ANYTHING, Charlie would still be with us.

He completely lost all mobility, was constantly sick and not eating, and had the worst ear infection our vet had ever seen that would NOT abate despite doing a $4000 end stage surgery (TECA). It was the kindest thing to do to put him down. We put him down, and I spiraled into depression, and did not leave my bed for a month, gave up on all my goals, and took a week off from work.

Eventually I started to slowly come back to the land of the living and after only about a month I saw an ad on Facebook for a dog needing an emergency foster home. I thought perhaps I was ready to help another dog. We met the rescue at a Petsmart one day and met a 2 year old GSD named Olive. I asked a ton of questions. They told us Olive was extremely friendly with people and children, but that she was not good in a home with other dogs. I dug more into that, asking if she was reactive on a leash - did she bark, lunge, or growl at other dogs? They told me no, told me she walked past them with no issues, she just didn‚Äôt like dogs to play with her. I thought, no problem, not planning on getting another dog. I watched a little kid stick her fingers into her cage to pet her. She seemed very friendly. 

The next Monday, I agreed to foster her. I drove out to get her only to find she was being kept in a muddy pen on a property with probably 20 other dogs roaming around. The woman who was keeping her could barely get her leash on. She seemed absolutely wired compared to the weekend. Seeing the other woman struggle, I took the leash and wrangled her into my car. The ride home was kind of crazy - mud everywhere, Olive jumping and me having to pull over several times to reseat her. 

When we got home, there were a few things that became pretty readily apparent. This dog had not lived inside before. Once we were home, she was really weird about being touched. She was super reactive to noises or anything that moved fast. She was terrified of the cars on the street and would try to run away from them. She was not house trained at all. I was not worried about these things at the time. I started putting her in a routine and got to business with training. Marv also needed a ton of training and I trained several horses from scratch, so it was not my first rodeo. 

She seemed great for the first month or so, and I was so excited things seemed to be going so well. I begged my partner to let us adopt her officially, and we did. We had her for Christmas and she did great with having my entire family over. My grandma even put her face near Olive‚Äôs face (why do people do this?), which made me really nervous and I warned her, but Olive did fine. No issues. All she did was steal presents all day and take them back to her crate.

It was a few months before things really started to come off the rails. Even though friends had been over many times before, and Olive only had positive experiences with them, one day she barked in my friends face when she leaned down to pet her. My friend backed off, Olive lay down for the rest of game night, no problem. Then she started to react to other dogs on leash in a big way. I can‚Äôt think of anything that would have caused it. It was just this slow and gradual descent into worse and worse behavior, despite my efforts to try to counteract it. I started training on walks and when friends were over, redirecting her with high value treats, teaching her a place command where she could go and not be bothered. Friends were instructed to ignore her or occasionally throw treats. On walks, I‚Äôd redirect her from reacting to other dogs, increasing distance and treat value. 

She just kept getting worse. I got a positive trainer in for a session, and she did okay. The second session, she panicked and reacted for the full 45 minutes and did not make any progress. We kept trying and it just kept getting worse. We tried anxiety medicine, a few different types until we settled on Prozac, which has seemed to improve things somewhat. We continued training. Things kept getting worse. I turned to management. She was crated when friends came over, but then she started to bark in the crate for the first five minutes or so. She usually settles, but she can no longer be out with friends unless I am completely ignoring my friends and doing a working training session. 

I finally managed to get the severe dog reactions under control. I can get her to heel past triggers without issue, but we cannot pass a dog on a leash. Usually I try my best to make distance and run into a random neighbor‚Äôs yard before she can react. So we can't take her anywhere, really, unless I'm geared up to go into full training mode. 

But here‚Äôs the real crux of the issue. Olive is really unpredictable. We‚Äôve worked a lot on body handling and she has been given baths several times at her boarding place. She seems great there - nervous, of course, but never any issues. But at home, she has snapped randomly at my partner so many times, and even sometimes me. She will come to him to get pets, seem to be enjoying it, and then randomly decided she no longer is enjoying it, and will move very quickly and snap at him. He will immediately back off. He has never done anything mean to her. He is a household member (albeit one who isn‚Äôt there as much as I am).

I‚Äôve been muzzle training her, and it‚Äôs taken weeks to even get her to wear it for a few minutes. But at this point, I am so beyond stressed out, and I don‚Äôt feel like I can do this anymore. I have given so much to this dog, I spend so many hours on her training, so much money paying trainers. I‚Äôve searched for a behaviorist but the closest one is 4 hours away and it‚Äôs $500 a session, and they are booked out for three months. 

In a tearful fight with my partner, who is now terrified of the dog, and does not like her anymore, we decided it would be best to try to rehome her. I drafted a long email to her rescue explaining that we have tried our best but we are unable to handle this issues, especially since we do eventually want to have kids, and we adopted her because we were told she was ‚Äúkid-friendly.‚Äù They refused to take her back and were unable to offer any help or resources whatsoever. I‚Äôve reached out to all the breed rescues in the state as well as breed rescues out of state and across the country - probably 15 in total. None of them can help. The local shelters (and non local) are euthanizing upon intake because they are so overrun. 

I know that people do not want to adopt a dog with these issues. I know why rescues are turning us away. But I just have such a hard time thinking that the option that is left for this dog, who 90% of the time is a sweet wiggly noodle, is behavioral euthanasia. She is only 3 years old. She is exceptionally physically healthy and smart. We have worked past a lot of issues - she can go on walks now, she can be out with friends on a leash, she is able to be handled on (almost) all parts of her body. She is super athletic and loves to play ball or go on a run. 

Is that really the only option for a reactive dog? Do I need to put down another dog, after putting my heart dog down just a year ago, and barely surviving how difficult that was? Even the idea of rehoming her was incredibly hard for me to come to. Please help.",Is it possible to rehome a reactive dog? Cry for help.,1673799648,7420,54,1431,11

My 13 year old senior (Pekingese Chihuahua mix) had to get his remaining teeth removed a few years ago, so he has been on a wet food diet ever since, we feed him twice a day. Other than that, he's pretty healthy for his age. 

We also have 2 cats that use automatic feeders to give them small, snack portions of dry food in-between their wet food meals. They both constantly think they are starving, so we got them these to trick them into thinking they get more food than they actually are. 

The thing is, my senior dog, looks legitimately sad when he sees them get more food than him. So I'm in search of an automatic feeder that can cater to a toothless dog. I already have trouble finding treats that are soft enough for him to eat. He hasn't had kibble since he lost his teeth, and he used to love kibble. Will it be super terrible to also give him small amounts of small bites kibble though out the day? Do they make automatic wet food feeders? He has tried to steal the cats food every once in awhile, so we know he can eat it. But is it healthy for him? He can't chew it, obviously, so I'm scared he will choke or mess up is tummy from not chewing the dry food. 

I don't want him to to eat too much, since he's a small dog. But I wanted to find a way to give him snacks at the same time as the cats. I'm work during the day, so I can't just go feed him myself every time they get their treat.

my boyfriend and i are really considering adopting a cat (unsure on a kitten or adult yet). we currently live in a rented home and haven't asked the landlord if it's okay yet, so this question is for if we can!

one of the reasons i'm worried about getting a cat is how my dog will react to it. i have a 7 year old boxer who lives with my parents but he is technically my dog. he's never come close enough to a cat but on walks, he does pull to get to them. can't tell if this is out of aggression or if he's just curious/wants to play. he's strong and still very energetic.

he lives a 10 minute walk away from us but doesn't come here often, although we have looked after him for a night and may need to do this again in the future. i wouldn't let him visit for the first few weeks or so of us having the cat, but my plan in that time was to give him a blanket or something with the cat's scent on it so he can get used to it (but please let me know if this isn't a good idea). i don't know where to go from there when it comes to them actually meeting. i would imagine we would need to keep him on a lead but i don't know if this would just frustrate him more.

422,dogs,"My family recently adopted a stray/shelter dog after a homestay of about 1 month, it was going pretty well an he seemed to be warming up with the idea of becoming part of our family, he seemed calm and we even took him to some outdoor cafes that allowed dogs and when we secured his leash to our table/chairs he was able to chill alongside us (which led to my complacency).

During my night walk with him (alone) I decided to get a drink from a vending machine at my apartment and since the last time I was at a vending machine with him and my sibling he didn't seem to like the sound of the can dropping, I decided to (stupidly) tie his leash to the very light aluminium chair at the sitting area behind me. Someone walked near the sitting area and he moved, causing the chair to screech and spook him into bolting off. He was sprinting off at top speed with no signs of stopping so I tried to chase him but he was extremely fast. 

Shortly after I informed my family who contacted his previous shelter and they coordinated a search party for him, since he was wearing an AirTag we managed to locate him in a forest behind our house but when he saw the search team he dashed past them again and has been gone ever since. 

We have been driving around trying to get a ping from the AirTag and have also posted missing posters on Facebook, around the vicinity and walking around trying to find him, its been almost 7 days since he was last seen (with no further pings from anyone) and we have been expanding our search area.

She started doing that under my birds' cages and on carpet at first for unknown reasons. Lately it has gotten worse and more frequent as she now chooses to take a piss in specific spots. My mom was in Greece for a week in august and Ally took a piss in her bed twice. My sister didn't allow her near our hamster's cage so Ally peed in front of the cage the same day. Yesterday I put her in a separate room to clean birds' cages and let them fly around just to find out she pissed on my hoodie. Today she pissed in front of the cages again while I was chatting with birds. We take Ally on walks 3 times a day, her urine looks normal, vet said she is healthy.

441,dogs,"A year and a half ago, I got a second dog. I never intended to have a second dog but a Mother dog was hit by a car (and died) in infront of my house, leaving 3 puppies behind. The pups were very young (about a month old) and were lingering next to their Mom's corpse. He's a mixed breed, deep chested dog. A mix between a Shiba cross Greyhound (I live in SE Asia). 

My neighbor was trying to catch the puppies so that they wouldn't succumb to the same fate that their Mother did. I helped and was able to catch one of the puppies while other neighbors were able to get the other 2 pups. Altogether, 2 boys and 1 girl. One neighbor took the female pup for her family to raise, and another neighbor gave the pup to a family member to raise while I took Tony in. 

I already had a dog. She was a year and 3 months old at the time that Tony came into our home. She's an American bully and she's been great with him from day one. She cuddled, played, slept near, and taught him dog things. I thought that this was wonderful, but as he got older - he didn't really warm up to my female dog. 

For example, Tony growls at her a lot, lunges and nips at her and this breaks my heart because she never reacts to him - she's just a sweet buff angel. He is very possessive over items - you have to give him LOTS of room or else he thinks you're coming for his stuff. He still wakes up at puppy time (4 a.m.) and demands to use the yard, doesn't settle even after exercise, destroys items in my home, cracked a window trying to escape because of seperation anxiety, growls when being petted, he invades other dogs space, he chases other dogs and children, he is very aggressive toward anyone coming close to our property. I work from home, so I'm caring for them every second of the day and it's been so difficult. I just don't feel like it's working out. 

He's been to the vet to check if he's in pain or if there's something else going on. He has to be muzzled because he's not the friendliest dude and he's highly mistrustful of other people, except me. He'll follow me anywhere - literally. 

I was looking online and I found a no kill shelter. I think about this ALL. THE. TIME, EVERYDAY.  It's so hard to go through with it because I genuinely believe that he would make an excellent dog for a family that didn't have any other dogs there. 

I don't want him to 'be looking for me' or thinking that I'm coming back to get him. I think that he'd love it but I'm not sure. I understand what a horrible person this is going to make me, because people will assume that I haven't tried everything but he's aggressive with my older dog. Sometimes during Zoom meetings, I have to rush to my female dogs aid because he's trying to scruff her aggressively.

453,dogs,"So I wanna preface this by saying I have been to the vet 3x now and my girl is on a treatment plan. I guess this is more to see if anyone has had simmilar experiences and to calm my nerves after being worried sick this whole week. 

It started Sunday night, my chi mix was up pacing the room which is very unlike her. Thinking she needs to go out I let her outside where she strains and only manages a very tiny amount of diarrhoea (sorry little graphic). Bear in mind her schedule was really thrown out of wack with the rains we have been having in CA (she pretty much refuses to in the rain no matter how much I try). 

Monday she is super lethargic and just not herself. I take her to the vet, vitals are normal, she‚Äôs a little dehydrated and recommends she take an antibiotic (metronazidole). I take her home and get her started on that.

She‚Äôs showing no signs of improvement and her lethargy has gotten worse. She really is not herself. She poops twice Tuesday (very dry) and Wednesday morning she has very soft yellow stool. 

Wednesday evening she actually yelps if you touch her belly so I take her straight to the emergency vet. They aren‚Äôt super worried as her vitals seem good still, they give her a shot for pain (which initially really helps) and send her home with 3 days worth of pain killers (Gabapentin).

Thursday she seems even more sluggish and lethargic and will not poop. I call the vet and get the next available appointment- Friday evening.

I take her in Friday and since it is now day 2 without pooping they do full blood panel and radiogram. Blood work comes back normal besides showing she‚Äôs pretty dehydrated (at this point she is still eating all her food but only drinking if I literally have the water in my hand). Her radiogram comes back showing her colon is full (of poop basically). So they give her an under the skin IV thing, prescribe laxatives (lactulose) and Royal Canin low fat gastrointestinal food. They told me to keep her on the course of antibiotics and Gabapentin.

So now it‚Äôs Saturday evening, she started her course of lactulose with her first dose Friday evening. She‚Äôs still eating, still fairly lethargic (tho I‚Äôm not sure how much the drugs are affecting this) but she did perk up a little at midday and had her tail wagging. She still is not drinking too much but seems more hydrated based on how much she‚Äôs peeing. I‚Äôve taken her outside once an hour today to try get her to poop and nothing. The vet did say give the lactulose 2-3 days to work and if by day 3 she hasn‚Äôt pooped bring her back. 

She hasn‚Äôt vomited, still eating (3 small meals a day) and still is peeing but will not poop! I am going crazy with worry that she‚Äôs still eating despite her colon being full! I‚Äôve spent too much time reading online about similar cases and now at scared for the worse to happen.

Has anyone had similar experiences? Or had a pet on lactulose? I love this dog more than life and I don‚Äôt know what I would do if anything happened to her.",Pup constipated going on day 4,1673764738,2990,30,555,6

455,dogs,"Hey everyone, been a tough stretch here, but we're getting through it.

__________________________________________

**BACKGROUND**

__________________________________________

I currently live by myself with a 2 year old border collie named Loki! He was a rescue and has some behavioral issues, none of them being aggression. He is very anxious, jumpy, and sortve clueless about manners despite constant teaching. Worst of all, he's very attached to those who stick around.

His background was when he was gotten as a puppy, his owner went blind over the course of a few months. They struggled to find him a home for nearly 6 months where he spent much of that time crated with not a ton of interaction, hopping family home to family home until they could find somebody.

That's where we come in. My ex and I, long term of a few years, had a 1 year old pup ourselves named Ares. She really wanted a dog, and while I wouldnt have gotten one myself, I ended up getting her Ares for our anniversary. Turns out it might be best if the pup we raised had a friend, but I was fine with it either way. This is where we found Loki.

He took a while to adjust, but he eventually clung to Ares pretty hard. While Loki didn't quite know how to even play, he always wanted to be around us or Ares. When one of us would leave on a trip, he'd be sad, but he was attached to that dog and my ex more than anything. If Ares would accompany any of us on those trips, Loki would be happy to see us but all his attention was on Ares. They were together for a bit over a year or so. Loki is a dog that needs a lot of attention, and while I work and am not the best at interacting constantly with animals, our situation of my ex being a dog lover and Ares loving his brother worked out perfectly.
__________________________________________

**WHAT CHANGED**
__________________________________________

Here's the bad news, some time ago my ex and I broke up. In this situation, I really wanted both dogs to stay together, but she has an extremely close bond with Ares. She also only really wanted to keep Ares and not bring Loki along because alone, she never would've gotten two dogs and it'd be far too much to manage.

In my corner, if I was alone, I wouldn't have gotten one dog, let alone two, but I was willing have both of them if it meant they could be together. Ares is fine with whatever, he's cool in any situation, but Loki has been distraught ever since they left. He needs to constantly be touching me, eats kind of erratically, and on walks he really wants to go see other dogs. He clearly LOVES me and sees me as a constant fixture in a life of revolving doors of people and animals, but I don't know if I have the time to give this much attention to him just on my own.

At the end of the day, she didn't envision herself alone with two dogs, just the one. I didnt envision myself with any, but I made it work with her since that's the life she wanted. Alone, I didn't see myself with any, but I feel a responsibility to Loki at the very least. I just don't know if I have what he needs?
__________________________________________

**TL;DR**
__________________________________________

So that's where I am asking you guys. Our original situation, a family with another dog, really worked for me and especially Loki. Now, it's just me and Loki. While he's clearly super attached to me, he is constantly whining and upset, checking in rooms where his brother and her used to be, etc.

I was going to try dog day care for a bit, but I think that misses the fundamental issue. I think he needs a family and that's not something I can provide, especially with a change in my career upcoming soon. It breaks my heart to even think of this. I cried a bit earlier today at the prospect of an empty home without him, but he's never happy unless I'm giving him constant direct attention at all times. I'm worried this isnt feasible for me and not a good life for him. I think he's afraid anybody could leave at any time, and is trying to keep me put.","Rehoming shatters my heart, but is it the right thing to do for both of us?",1673763304,4035,75,741,16

Hi friends, I‚Äôm hoping someone could lead to the right direction. I have an two year old American Bully who is a neutered male, he is very healthy and active. 

On December 29, 2022, he came inside after relieving himself and I always wipe his anal area to keep it hygienic and clean. When I did, I noticed blood around his anal area but no blood in his stool. I booked him for a vet visit the next day. His stool was very loose and like diarrhea. 

December 30th, 2022, he goes in and he gets sedated. The vet expressed his anal glands, and said he had a abscesses forming but everything else was in good shape from looking at the fluid in his anal glands. He was on Vanectyl P for dermatologist reasons, and had a diarrhea episode from either his new food (Purina Pro Plan DVM) or the medication. The vet said that the medication could be the problem, so I stopped using it right away. 

For a week, he still was having anal gland secretion/bloodily tinged liquid out of his anal area. The vet said it was normal, and i kept giving him the antibiotic that he was prescribed. His stool isn‚Äôt diarrhea anymore, it‚Äôs normal. 

January 8th, 2023, after two or three days of no anal glad secretion or blood, I noticed a tiny amount again. I called his vet and i was given a probiotic supplement to add into his food once a day for 10 days. 

I‚Äôve been giving him the supplements for 4 days. There isn‚Äôt any blood in his stool, just around his anal area. What else can I do? Is the problem his diet? His diet is Purina Pro Plan DVM.

Edit: He isn‚Äôt in pain, he‚Äôs not scooting or licking his anal area. He‚Äôs eating and drinking as normal. Very active and playful.",Anal Gland Abscesses,1673763185,1659,20,313,3

It started when my husband and I wanted to adopt our first dog. We are both adults with very good income who own a house on 16 acres. Between our schedules we are away from the house for 6 hours at most. We were turned down by multiple rescues immediately for not having a fenced in yard and because one of us didn't work from home. I even explained I had just finished my degree and was in the process of apply for remote jobs but we were still turned town. Fast forward we got our current dog from a breeder, I am working from home, and we take exceptional care of him.

Recently a coworker asked me if I would like a small puppy that she was planning on surrendering to the local dog pound within the next week. I unfortunately can't take the puppy as my dog does not do well with other dogs and needs to be the only dog in the house. Because of my love of animals I asked my coworker to wait to surrender the puppy and I would at least find a rescue with a foster home. I called 6 different rescue groups as well as sending them all emails letting them know it was urgent to find a foster home for a puppy. It's been 5 days and only 1 out of 6 emailed me back. I completely get these organizations are usually understaffed but 5 days is ridiculous. The one that emailed asked if the puppy is up to date on shots and dewormed. I again explained it's not my dog and just a coworker who I'm not very close with. An hour later when I relayed to the rescue that the puppy has had no shots or dewormer she proceeded to tell me I'm lucky this puppy isn't dead and lecture me on the importance of vet care asking me why this wasn't done. Again explained I am simply trying to intervene and do not personally know this person. I was told she would be in contact, it's now been 2 days and not a word and follow up emails are going unreturned.

I‚Äôm a full time pet sitter in portland OR. I‚Äôve recently seen a rise in the use of security cameras inside homes. 

I have no issues with cameras as it‚Äôs not my home and I have some around my home as well. 

During a stay this weekend, I noticed a camera in the dining room of a clients home, that I wasn‚Äôt made aware of. I understand it‚Äôs for their safety/peace of mind, and I would never do anything I wouldn‚Äôt want the owners to see in person, but I‚Äôd just prefer to know if I‚Äôm on camera, if that seems reasonable? Knowing there are cameras inside would never deter me or result in me turning down a gig.

As soon as he settled in at our home he started aggressive/ scared barking at all strangers and dogs on walks. A few months later he started nipping/ biting randomly at new people in our home. Not horrible bites but enough to tear holes in pants and sometimes leave a small mark/some blood. it was just quick ‚Äúim afraid - back off‚Äù bites. He didn‚Äôt pursue.

476,dogs," 

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes, this will be the first dog that I will own. But my brother owns two dogs and we have dog sat for him on multiple occasions, once for around 3 weeks.

 2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\] 

No, I do not have a preference. but in my area, the rescue doesn't have many dogs so a rescue may not be an option

 3) Describe your ideal dog. 

A dog that will be energetic and playful but also be able to just sit around the house. Likes to cuddle and be around humans but also like time to themselves. Not prone to barking or shedding. Smart, clean, and friendly.

 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

Border terriers. I like that they like to play and be outside and also that they are low shedding. They also look cute.

 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

Just the basics. Other than being housetrained and knowing a few basic commands(sit, stay, roll over, and shake) they don't have to be heavily trained

 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

No, looking for a fun family dog

 **Care Commitments** 

 7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

Me and my son, we love spending time with animals and can hand out and be around him for most of the day(other than during school and work).

 8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

My son likes to go on runs and walks every day even without a dog, so we would be able to exercise him for up to 2 hours but would prefer closer to just an hour a day. We are planning to take him on walks, jogs, hikes, and just playing fetch or other games in the backyard. We do not live that close to a dog park so that would not be a very common thing.

 9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

I am fine with brushing him once or twice a week. We can deal with cleaning ears, bath them, and other basic grooming requirements but would not be trimming their hair ourselves

 **Personal Preferences** 

 10) What size dog are you looking for?

Any size other than large. 

 11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

Would prefer minimal shedding and slobber, we can handle barking but not too much. 

 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

not important

 **Dog Personality and Behavior** 

 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

A Would like the dog to like to cuddle with us a lot of the time but would also like them to chill by themselves at times.

 14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please? 

A mix of both

 15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? 

Friendly, I don't want them to be loud or very jumpy when someone is at the door. With strangers and visitors, anything is fine as long as they aren't aggressive

 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

Would prefer them to be indifferent or friendly to other dogs.

 17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid? 

just not too much shedding or slobber

 **Lifestyle** 

 18) How often and for how long will the dog be left alone? 

Just for work and school (7-8 hours), other than that someone is always home.

 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

my son and I both love dogs and will do almost everything. My wife doesn't like animals as much but will still feed or let the dog out.

 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?  

We have one small lovebird that is very quiet and is just in my sons room

 21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

Just my son that is 15

 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

No

 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? 

Vancouver, BC Canada and no

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

I have yet to find any proper rundowns comparing the top four (I think they are anyway) dog GPS collar brands. After wrapping up my testing this evening, figured I'd share my results in hopes that someone else may find some use here.

Prior to purchasing and testing all four, I ranked them as follows based on basic online research (reviews, forums, videos, etc.):

1. Fi (series 2)
2. Whistle
3. Fitbark
4. Tractive

After playing with each in person for a few hours, my new rank:

1. Tractive
2. Fi
3. Whistle
4. Fitbark

I am not going to provide a lengthy in-depth review or full feature comparison; however, going to hit on a few key areas that ultimately enabled me to make my decisoion. I put roughly \~3 hours of testing into this once I had them all setup, and a victor quickly emerged that resulted in not pursuing further tests. 

A few upfront notes. It's the Fi Series 2, because the series 3 pricing is just insane. Fitbark is the Fitbark GPS. Whistle is Health &amp; GPS. The Fitbark I later realized was running factory firmware as my first attempt to update failed. 

I did not test any of the health features either, as noted above, I stopped my homework early. I originally planned to test them out for a week together but wasn't worth the hassle. 

There are absolutely many other considerations you should probably take when looking at these options. I originally had many more tests I wanted to run through and document, but after experiencing several frustrations with each, I knew my path forward. Did I ultimately pick the right one? Who knows ... only time will tell. 

**Hardware**

Fi requires its own collar, which is big and bulky. The device itself is vastly larger than all the others, also much heavier. It looks cool and all, but after playing with the others, this thing is just too big. It also requires a proprietary charger, but at least it's on a home base which is nice ... that uses micro-usb (c'mon). 

Whistle is tiny and light, very nice. Also, can be fitted to any standard sized collar ... with frustration. There are two variants, one with velcro, one with a belt like slider. The velcro one, I don't understand, as it would turn the device into a hanging dongle off the dog's neck, pointless. The slider type one, I must be a big dumb animal, because I couldn't figure it out. In playing with it, I snapped the pieces into place, and then could not undo it - even with force, thus being unable to attach it properly to a collar. Even though it's micro-usb (again, c'mon), it's nice that it's not a proprietary charger. 

Fitbark is also tiny and light, even more so than whistle. At first, I thought the zip ties were a bad design choice, but actually they're quite nice as they give you utlimate versatility pending on the size of your dogs collar. There's a face plate that snaps over the device to protect the charger and allows you to charge without having to cut/redo the zip ties. Sadly, they use a very weak old-school fitbit like proprietary charger. It feels very cheap, like it will absolutely break within weeks to months.

Tractive, ended up being my favorite design. There are four rubber-band like connections that enable a quick on/off to any collar. With a much larger dog/collar, it may not fit as well, but worked like a champ for both of my dogs. While there is play in device while on the collar (it can shift left to right), it doesn't seem like it will fall off without a fight. Sadly ... another proprietary charger, damnit! Yet, it's quite stable/secure. Still, why!!! 

\--- Winner: Tractive (minus the stupid charger)

**Software**

Fi is the clear winner on looks. They definitely hired some UX developers and made a very modern/fancy look/feel. Has a very social like element to it. I still found the navigation to be a bit cumbersome, but it did the job. Yet, no options to modify/manage subscription within the app. It sends you to external links that truly send you for multiple loops ... you must fill out a damn web form to change/cancel your subscription, cool!

Whistle is all around incredibly well designed. Intuitive and easy to navigate. Good chance I'm just dumb and missed it, but I saw no option to switch to any type of real time live tracking. Also enabled me to modify/cancel my subscription in the app and was refunded within seconds - the ony one of the bunch that allowed for this.

Fitbark ... yikes. This thing feels very dated. The font, layout, look, feel, it's a bit of an eye sore to say the least. Of the bunch though, the only one that had in app support (chat) that responded within SECONDS! mass props here for the customer service element. 

Tractive is also quite nice. I really appreciate their history feature showing movement with filters of time and heatmaps. Overall navigation is quite simple, with the exception of finding where to setup additional Safe Zones/Virtual Fences. Had to Google it, then felt dumb, but not overly easy to find on your own at first.

\--- Winner: Whisper

**Subscription Costs**

Fi is better on Series 2 than 3 as the latter, is a joke for their subscription model (they lumped hardware and sub into one, and it's so much more expensive over time with minimal upgrades compared to the Series 2). For Series 2, they offer a one year for $100, two years for $186, three year for $248.

Whistle $80 a year.

Fitbark $96 for one year, $168 for two years, $216 for three years.

Tractive $108 for one year, $168 for two years, $300 for five years.

\--- Winner: Whistle if yearly, Tractive if larger purchase ($300 for five years = $60 per year)

**Tracking (GPS/Cellular)**

Fi worked quite well. Notified me within \~2-3 minutes of zone departure. Live tracking prompted me to wait 60 seconds for next update - yeah, that's not ""live"". Still, the frequency and accuracy of updates definitely beat Whistle and Fitbark, not Tractive though.

Whistle only notified me of virtual fence departure 1 of the 3 times I tested ... and it took \~5 minutes. Further, it would take \~15 minutes for overall location to update. Even worse, request a manual location update - never processed (tried three times). 

Fitbark unfortunately lagged behind along with Whistle in taking FAR too long to update unless I requested a manual update. It was roughly \~11-15 minutes until update. \*\*\*WORTH NOTING\*\*\* I did not realize my firmware update failed until later, I did my testing on factory firmware, this may be much better with the updates.

Tractive is the only one that offered real time, immediate responses to ""live"" tracking. This was an instant win for me. Further, it was the fastest to notify of departure from the virtual fence (\~1 minute).

\--- Winner: Tractive 

**Closing thoughts**

These seemed to be the best of the bunch based on my little homework on the topic and sadly, none of these are perfect. I am not well knowledged on this topic and how long GPS Dog Collars have been around, but it's clear that there's more work to be done in this space. With the little time I've put into it thus far, I feel relatively confident in Tractive, and signing up for the 5 year plan to get the bigger subscription discount. Hope it doesn't come back to bite me in the ass, but only time will tell.

501,dogs,"Hello everyone, I just need a place to express my feelings since it‚Äôs a horrible week for me, and I want your honest opinion if you think I‚Äôm doing the right thing‚Ä¶
I adopted Apolo when he was just a puppy, he has always been very loving and full of happiness. Now he‚Äôs turning 2 on February, he‚Äôs about 60 pounds. 

(I AM SUMMING UP ALL I CAN APOLOS CASE, TRUST ME, HE HAS TRIED OTHER MEDICATION BUT REACTED BADLY TO THE INITIAL MICRO-DOSE. IM ONLY TELLING YOU THE MAIN EVENTS, SO IF YOU THINK OF OTHERS TREATMENTS OR TESTS, CHANCES ARE WE HAVE TRIED IT)

On January of last year things radically changed, he started being anxious all day, couldn‚Äôt be left alone, developed barrier frustration, separation anxiety, hyperactivity and excessive barking, so I took him to the vet to have him neutered, they also did some blood test (anything you can think of) and recommended us a trainer and an ethologist (who told us to take him to doggy day care). 

We started on an intense obedience training with the trainer, daily exercise on doggy daycare, mental exercise at home and a routine, but nothing worked at all. About 3 months in, the trainer said he couldn‚Äôt help us anymore since there was no progress, and the best choice would be to put him down, but we kept trying. The ethologist didn‚Äôt help us much either and suggested the same thing the trainer did, so we got a second opinion. We also tried every natural remedy out there (Bach flowers, music therapy, CBD, essential oils, massage therapy, weighted blankets, chamomile, etc).

One day around June at doggy day care, Apolo bit a girl that worked there (category 2 bite) because she tried to take something away from him, but since it was the first time it had happened, they let it slide. I was stunned by this since he had never been aggressive or reactive whatsoever, everyday I felt like he was changing a little bit more. A couple of days later we went to his ethologist and she recommended us to get him on trazodone. 

A month later, two people from the doggy day care came to pick him up, and when they tried to get him in the van, Apolo bit one of them out of nowhere, so he stopped going and I started exercising him myself. As weeks passed by, he started being more reactive towards other dogs and people on the dog park, and the trazodone didn‚Äôt seem to work, so eventually his ethologist (who is also a neurologist) ordered more tests, and after all the failed treatment and new symptoms arising, she diagnosed him with HYPERKINESIS, a very rare condition. 

After we got a second opinion on the diagnosis and confirmed it, we started treatment for that right away (fluoxetine and behavioral), but things kept getting worse and worse. He wakes me up at least 3 times at night asking for attention and to go running, he eats everything he sees, if he hyperventilates he starts scratching me and biting me till I get bruises, he‚Äôs very territorial so no one can come over, he can‚Äôt sleep if I‚Äôm not home. 

My parents have spent thousands of dollars and I feel awful about asking them for more because I know it‚Äôs not easy for them to do so, my mom calls me crying because she doesn‚Äôt know how to calm him down while I‚Äôm at school and she‚Äôs working from home, plus I have severe mental health issues and this situation has made me seriously unstable, it‚Äôs affecting my studies, my relationship, my family, but besides all that, I know I‚Äôm not giving Apolo the best life he can have, the life he deserves. My house is small and he is huge, I promised myself I would take care of him everyday of his life and that I wouldn‚Äôt give up on him, but I just can‚Äôt anymore, I cry everyday from the sadness and frustration, I don‚Äôt have a life besides from him anymore, I almost never see my friends, I stopped going to the gym, I‚Äôve lost 30 pounds from anxiety and I just see him get worse everyday. 

After one year of unsuccessful treatment and his condition getting worse his ethologist said that the best thing would be to rehome him to a farm where he can run all he wants or put him to sleep‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve decided to rehome him, I found a trustworthy person that lives a couple hours away from me on a farm and is completely aware of his condition. 

I feel like I‚Äôm giving up on him, like if I tried a little harder things would get better, but at the same time keeping Apolo is not just affecting me, it‚Äôs affecting everyone around him. But mostly him‚Ä¶ Am I being selfish?",Am I the worst owner ever?,1673743106,4433,26,817,6

They used to play, sleep, eat, share toys for over a year. Our rescue is mildly food aggressive where if another dog gets close while she's eating she'll give off a warning bark.
In addition, if our Brittany is trying to play when the rescue doesn't want to, ie putting her front paws on the rescues back and pushing her, another warning bark from rescue and her hair stands up. Conflict over.
In August we rescued another much smaller puppy. Everything was fine no issues all dogs got along. Both rescues used to show dominance to the Brittany by mounting.
Starting in December, the Brittany started attacking the same age rescue dog, always after they had all finished eating. Was usually short lived after I would fuss at them to stop. Then it progressed more and more into she wouldn't stop until I separated them (wheel barrow method). Always after meals. Also noticed that the previous mounting was no longer occurring.
Now it's progressed to after meals, and if I'm giving out affection. Last night they fought, Brittany instigated, because I pet the Brittany and the other dogs came up to me for affection as well, instant attack to same age rescue. I pulled them apart and held onto the Brittany until her body language relaxed, the rescue went and hid in the corner. Once I let her go she ran up to the rescue went rigid and froze, I called her name twice, she backed down the retreated to opposite ends of the room and slept. 
3 hours later I open the door for a potty break, puppy goes out immediately, Brittany and same age rescue are at a standoff  behind me, Brittany wouldn't let the rescue go outside. I was able to separate them before an actual fight ensued.
I do not understand why this has happened all of a sudden. I cannot express how happy easy going and tail wagging the Brittany is to all people and dogs, this behavior is not in her character. On top of it, they're together for 12 hours having the best time, playing, zero issues.

He already knows sit, stay, no, lay down, come, and drop it.  Up until 2 or 3 days ago, he enthusiastically practiced and followed these commands, almost without fail, including ""come"" even if he was really excited about something else, and ""drop it"" no matter how tasty the thing he picked up was.

But a couple of days ago, he just... stopped.  As if he just stopped caring what was said entirely.  Treats incentivize him slightly, anf he slowly, grudgingly performs the command for a treat occasionally, but just a few days ago, training time was his favorite thing besides walks on the beach.  Now, he stares at the treat and decides whether he wants to sit for it.  He would come running without fail and the ""come"" command, now he does not respond at all.

This problem started very suddenly, as in one day he was great, and the next morning, nothing and nothing since.  His routine hasn't changed, his setting hasn't changed, nothing has been changed at all in his day to day life.  Training time has gone from something he loved, to something he has zero interest in whatsoever.  He doesn't even pause or look at us when we say ""no"" or ""drop it"" even though he was following these instructions to an impressive degree, almost perfectly, just a day earlier.  He ignores every command.

My poor little guy has developed some bumps near his mouth, so I took him in to the vet. She took a short look at it, and said it looked like a staph infection to her. 

I asked what treatment was needed, and she at first said we could wait and see. Then she looked at it again and said ‚ÄúActually, it‚Äôs pretty bad‚Äù and prescribed him Cephalexin. 

I‚Äôve already given him his first dose, but I‚Äôm a bit worried. It just doesn‚Äôt look like the pictures of staph infections I‚Äôm seeing when I Google it.

She can‚Äôt eat properly because of her tongue and takes more time than our other dogs. She can‚Äôt shake her back so after swims we have to run her so she can dry her tail. She shreds A LOT. By a lot I mean, if you just so as pet her white fur it comes off straight away. But she seems to have a lot of it that she doesn‚Äôt start balding. She loves to run, swim, walk and chill out in the sun. The sun is such a problem too cause she‚Äôs prone to sun burn if she stays out too long but ahe just LOVES to sun bathe and I cannot blame her. I know she‚Äôs getting old and I want to make her as comfortable as she can be.

Recently, she‚Äôs been having disruptive behaviour. She keeps scratching herself especially around the face until she starts bleeding and doesnt stop. The bleeding is drops of blood from the site mostly her chin. She started doing this for maybe a month now.  We‚Äôve applied betadine each time she bled to prevent any infection. We started to put a cone around her head for 1-2 weeks now hoping this would stop her.

525,dogs,"Two weeks ago, my new buddy [1 year old, 15 lb mystery mutt] was on the ‚Äúat risk‚Äù list at the city shelter because he was so scared &amp; snappy that he couldn‚Äôt be handled. My resident dog has the magical ability to share his excessive confidence with our temporary buddies, so I agreed to take him.

This poor guy was so scared they had to use a catch pole to get him out of his kennel, and I was like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOkay, this is going to be a tough one.‚Äù

Three hours after he was in my apartment (hiding &amp; peering from behind doorways), it was time to take my dog out, so I figured I‚Äôd leave him alone to continue his decompression while I walked my dog.

As soon as he saw the leash, he ran to the door &amp; sat, wiggling. I was like, ‚ÄúDude, I‚Äôm not sure about trying to harness you cuz you were real bitey just a few hours ago.‚Äù But he was so excited that I gave him a shot, and the harnessing &amp; walk went amazingly well. He ignored people and wanted to politely greet other dogs (which I obviously didn‚Äôt allow because I barely knew him, and he accepted my decision and just continued walking).

Turns out he‚Äôs fully house-trained, knows basic commands, and has been crate-trained &amp; trained to stay off the furniture and only chew on toys. 

He‚Äôs a high-energy puppy &amp; can be a pain in the ass when he decides it‚Äôs playtime, but he‚Äôs probably the best-trained foster I‚Äôve ever had. And he was *so close* to not being able to bring his skills &amp; exuberance to his future forever family.

Fostering seriously saves lives. Some great dogs just can‚Äôt cope in a shelter environment to the point that it‚Äôs cruel &amp; damaging to keep them there. The only options are euthanasia, adoption (impossible if they‚Äôre too stressed to get properly evaluated), or fostering.

If you think you *maybe* could foster, I highly encourage you to research options in your area. A good shelter/rescue will have very clear information about what support they provide, and what the procedure is when you end up with a foster beyond your abilities.",Bragging about my latest foster buddy &amp; encouragement to foster if you can,1673730835,2039,78,371,13

532,dogs,"My best friend Spirit is 11.

He has been with me through some hard times. He is my emotional support, my rock, and my family.

Two months ago I went on a trip out of the country and boarded my boy at his usual place. When I came home, I noticed some swelling under his left eye. I thought it was just allergies and since he wasn't acting any different, I didn't think anything about it.  He is a huge baby, so I figured if it was serious he would be showing it. 

After two weeks and the swelling getting worse, I brought him to the vet. He is a feisty ornery dog, so he has to be muzzled at the vet. Due to this, they couldn't look in his mouth. Told me it was most likely an infected tooth. Gave us some antibiotics and booked teeth cleaning, but they were booked for a few months. The earliest they could get me was the end of Jan. 

After the antibiotics were done, his swelling didn't go down. Still no changes in appetite, still no visible pain - nothing. Called the vet, and was told that happens sometimes and that they will know more when he comes in for teeth cleaning. 

A few days later he cut his foot (He had a skin tag on the bottom of his paw that cut open). Brought him to the vet to get it checked out. A new vet came in to check it out and the moment she walked into the room she was extremely concerned. Not about his foot, but the swelling below his eye. She was aware of his records and was concerned it hadn't gone down. Informed me then that it was 50% a tumor and not an infection... I balled like a baby. Just in case, she prescribed another, higher dosage of antibiotics and pushed his teeth cleaning up a few weeks, that was on Monday. 

The tumor they found in his mouth, pushed out all his back teeth on the left side. They removed as much as they safely could and took samples for a biopsy. 

Just got the results a few hours ago. They said he had a very aggressive form of mouth cancer... 

My options from what they told me...

If I do nothing, they said he probably only has a few weeks left. I just can't fathom that. He is eating fine, he is still playing... He is a little lethargic, but I figured that was due to the medicine he is on for comfort.

I could talk to an oncologist to see if they can remove the tumor completely... This would cost 5-10k or more... and would only give him about 6 months to a year.. maybe. 

I don't know what to do.. what is best. I don't want him to suffer. 

I feel so stupid that I didn't get his eye checked out sooner. I feel so stupid that I waited for his teeth cleaning, maybe I could have called around to find someone to do it sooner? 

I'm a mess right now and just needed to get out some of this. I knew I would have to make a hard decision eventually, but I didn't think I would have to so soon.",A painful choice I will have to make / background story.,1673727475,2778,56,550,11

Since then we've bonded and when she's not having an episode it's wonderful.  But watching the episodes and caring for her has really worn me down.

536,dogs,"I reached out the last time my dog had an episode. It turned out to be her 2nd old dog episode. She still has balance issues and gets confused. Going outside to go potty has been difficult but whereas we used to have to stabilize her hips to go down the stairs, she can now go down them on her own and not fall most of the time. These are 3 steps from our house to outside. 

The scariest thing happened yesterday. We took her to the vet for her yearly shots and check up. She used to always be excited to go places but lately she has so much trouble with the car. She is a shar pei so she is a good 45-50 pounds. We have to lift her into the back seat. I stayed back there with her but she wouldn‚Äôt lay down or stay still. I basically just hugged her so she wouldn‚Äôt fall. 

Only one person can go into the vet at a time so I waited in the car. Kelsa started having breathing problems and couldn‚Äôt catch her breath at all. The doctor things she has laryngeal paralysis. 

When she came out she couldn‚Äôt get a breath. My husband was still finishing up things inside and I was trying to hug her, sing to her, give her water, but nothing was helping. Usually if I sing to her she will calm down a bit. When hubs came out and started driving it was like that the whole 25 minute ride home. 

She was prescribed gabapentin and some pain killers. We gave her a gabapentin when we got home and eventually she calmed down and then seemed pretty drugged out. 

The vet called and she tested negative for everything except Lyme (which she has had for about 10 years. She is about 16 now). We had to get her pee and poo to bring in next week for some other tests. 

There are some surgical options but the outcomes don‚Äôt sound great and the procedures can kill the dog themselves. 

I used to think her episodes of not being able to breathe were her making pain noises. I‚Äôm with her all day as I‚Äôm not working right now. My husband told me immediately that they weren‚Äôt pain noises when he got in the car but when we got home he said she never did that at home, which isn‚Äôt true because she does and I‚Äôve told him about them. 

We switched from dry food to small amounts of wet food more often during the day. She used to choke on her food and I thought she was eating too fast. We haven‚Äôt been able to walk her more than down the driveway for a while because she stops being able to breathe. 

I‚Äôm just so scared of her hurting and having a declining quality of life. Her mind isn‚Äôt there anymore. Honestly if I were in her shape I wouldn‚Äôt want to live. I‚Äôve come to peace with the fact that she is going to leave us soon. 

My husband is ‚Äúfighting for her life‚Äù because he thinks she has another year or two left. I just want it to be peaceful when she passes and not happen because she suffocates. He can‚Äôt give her up yet. It pains me that he is going to let her keep going downhill. 

I just was looking for support because since my husband and I don‚Äôt see eye to eye on this, he cannot validate my feelings of being super scared and sad.

537,dogs,"Hoping I might be able to crowdsource some insight since my vet can't figure out what's wrong. Here's the situation:

Last night I was over at a neighbor's house for dinner. When we got up to leave I noticed my dog (2 year old mixed breed male) was acting strange - not wanting to get up off the floor, acting uncoordinated and a little out of it. He perked up and was acting normal on our short (and very cold) walk home, but once we got inside he started acting super strange - wobbling, back legs kind of stumbling/buckling, wanting to lay down, hunching over, trembling, seeming weak and very out of it. I immediately brought him to the urgent care at the local animal hospital. Symptoms continued while there, he also started dripping urine (urinary incontinence). Vet said his vitals were normal, he didn't seem to be in pain. She did an ultrasound and said his kidneys looked normal, ran a urine drug test which came back negative. He was exhausted when we got home and slept solidly through the night (he usually gets up and moves a few times). This morning he was a lot better - all symptoms were gone except a bit of lethargy. We went back to the hospital to get blood work done for kidney function (vet was concerned about possible antifreeze poisoning), and everything was normal. He seems totally normal now but I am still very freaked out. He had three very big poops this morning (more than usual) but otherwise is back to his usual peppy self.

I called my neighbors to ask if there is anything he possibly could have gotten into and they said no. The only unusual thing he had last night was some dog biscuits they gave him - blueberry maple bacon biscuits that came from a bag that had been sealed until I arrived and opened it. Possible these could have been old and gone bad maybe?

He does sometimes run around the neighborhood so it's possible he got into something? But he was inside and in my sight for the 4 hours leading up to symptoms onset.

A few months ago I had to put down my dog. Her name was princess and she meant so much to me 
I feel horrible for the way she passed because she was in so much pain.
I always thought that when it was her time to go I would've gotten a day to spoil her with all her favorite treats and toys but I didn't get to.
Everything went down hill so fast Everything was fine and then she just started getting sicker and sicker after we took her to this one kennel because we had to go somewhere  for 3 days and about a week or two after that is when this all started to happen 
She would throw up constantly throughout the day and after a few days she started to have problems with standing up she would try to get up but fall back down multiple times
We tried calling the vet on the first day we noticed how bad it got but they were closed and when we tried calling again asking if someone could come to our house to check her they declined we couldn't get her into the car because of how heavy she was so for the next 2 or 3 days Princess stayed like that until we were able to get a person to come to finally come to our house and check on her and see if she needed to be euthanized 
I remember staying up all night watching her so I could clean her the best I could whenever she threw up 
I remember being confident and hopeful that she would get through this but I was wrong..when the person came to check her she thought it was the best to go ahead and put her down.
I was heartbroken this is the first death I've experienced in my entire life with something I care so much about 
I miss her so much and I just wish I could see her one last time it's been months and I still cry about her almost every day .

we couldn't even keep her ashes due to us being low on money .
My boyfriend told me I could've asked him for the money but I didn't know and by the time I knew it was too late her body is already gone in the ocean 

My biggest regret is not asking him for the money I wish I could've kept her ashes...especially since she hates water..she wouldn't even want to be in the ocean 

I also feel bad for allowing her to be put down because she didn't want to die and I know that for a fact...she was trying her best to fight through whatever was happening to her she didn't want to go. If I had the money I would've taken her to the best vet so she could've lived but I couldn't and I hate myself so much for that .

 He began drinking water like crazy and urinating over 10 times a day, even going in the house. We brought him to the vet and after some tests it was determined he had signs of kidney failure. We were given antibiotics to treat for leptospirosis and Lyme disease while waiting for test results for those. It was determined he had leptospirosis and we kept him on the medication. 2 weeks after starting he was brought back for another round of lab results. These came back even worse than before.

To the point where he now flinches. It‚Äôs awful to see. The living situation is he lives with my dad 2 weeks of the month and then visits us for 4-7 days. I think it‚Äôll be easier to just list his behavioural problems:
-no recall, to the point where if you let him off the lead he will run away from you and often has to be caught by strangers because he will not be caught. 
-he paws and jumps up constantly and he is a very large dog
-he cannot settle himself for example today he‚Äôs been a walk this morning and a 3.5 mile run. He has not stopped pacing or pestering for 2 hours. 
-he is extremely jealous of my mum, he‚Äôs not aggressive but I don‚Äôt like the way he is so hyperactive around her. Constantly sniffing chasing and pawing. He even cocks his leg on her sometimes to pee? Can someone explain why he does this to me?

558,dogs,"I am looking at needing to make a big choice here soon. Context: when I was about 15, our family adopted a puppy. As she grew, it soon got to the point where I (being the one in the house who spent time training her) was the only one who could take her anywhere. We often say that she is a completely different dog with me. 

Anyway, five years later, I am getting close to graduating college and finding a job. However, the career I really want to look into is a job as a firefighter. I have two semesters of college and 6 months of a technical school program left. Here is the problem: I have been told that I need to take the dog with me, and I do really want to take the dog with me, but I don't know how to handle the long 24hr+ shifts and still get her cared for. 

My parents have said that they would be willing to keep her, when I move out, but they seem really really reluctant which has me worried about how she would do in their house without me when I do eventually move out. I am feeling like I will probably need to find something else to do as a career (I am getting a degree in IT, so probably some kind of desk job even though I cannot stand my desk job) but the idea of giving up the firefighter dream for this dog makes me very sad.

What we have not been able to manage are his serious skin problems. Under his chin, he has multiple really nasty rash patches. It is so itchy and because of his arthritis, he is really struggling and hurting himself itching it. he tries to get us to itch it any time we are near him, and when we stop he rubs his chin on our legs/hands. 

We've been to the vets for it plenty, but Vet care within my country is less holistic and more pharma-maximising. He has been prescribed antibiotic cream which has not done anything, and I have my own personal reservations about antibiotic anything. 

I have tried changing his dog bowls from steel to ceramic and daily wet wipe cleansing. I suspected it was impacted follicles, which I'm not too well versed on, but I pluck the hairs within the rashes and they come out easily. But still the rashes remain. More recently he's been getting a few skin tags that are growing larger, but again the vet does not think they are a concern.

571,dogs,"Hey all, 

I'm writing this because I'm just looking for any insight or advice that we are doing the right thing. We have my old baby's euthanasia scheduled for today. 

A big knot popped up on his knee back in mid October 2022. He started limping from this in Nov. We found out it was hemangiosarcoma in Nov. We went to another vet just to get a second opinion. Same thing. This second vet also said they were worried the tumor would burst at some point and that, that would be the cause of his death. The first vet never mentioned that being a possibility so of course I was internally freaking out. Both vets also said the tumor was too big to try to cut out. That there wouldn't be enough skin to close him back up. 

Of course, I started to look up all kinds of things online and saw things like. Weeks to months from diagnosis is what we were looking at. And since the knot was first noticed, it HAS gotten bigger and since he doesn't really put weight on that leg anymore, I guess all muscle mass disappeared quickly so it's like. Boney except his giant softball knot. 

He still has happy energy. He does sleep a lot due to the pain meds. (the vet said he also has arthritis all over). But there are things he can't do anymore that I know he loves. Like jumping on the couch to look out of the window or just jumping on the couch at all, running and chasing cats or squirrels, looking out of the window on car rides. I've seen him fall back a few times like the leg just gives out or something. Doesn't eat as much most of the time. But since the last vet visit, they recommended letting him have some chicken and rice because he would scarf that down. And he does. I give that for lunch. But he still probably eats one bowl of his normal food a day along with this. And treats whenever he goes out. So he's eating normal enough, drinking water fine and going to the bathroom a normal amount of times a day. 

He's the best boy and I want to give him the longest best life I can, but I definitely don't want him to have a death like the tumor bursting. Even more so that he lives with my dad. He was/is the family dog. I always thought I would take him when I got an apartment. But then I felt bad doing that as he has lived in a house for so many years I didn't want to give him a smaller living space and also always having to be on a leash when going to the bathroom. So sleepovers it was. Then I was like. Okay. When I get a house. So we did, but he was 14 at this point so then I felt bad to take him from his home he's always known. So we still did regular sleepovers. On top of the possible tumor burst, it's that he would be at my dad's while he's working and die alone. This fear has grown with the tumor getting bigger. 

I always hoped I could have him for as long as I could until I could get that ""I'm tired, I'm ready to go"" look. But his tumor has me so worried constantly. I've searched your all's stories + stories online and just reading about when the tumor bursts....I don't want him to go out that way. That sounds so traumatizing for both the dog and family. I just wonder if I'm doing this too soon.

598,dogs,"Hello!

Three days ago, my family's dog had a seizure that lasted about six minutes. My mom then went on a trip to visit family (nothing wrong with that -- help was needed), and I and my siblings were told to keep an eye on him.

I've asked my mom and dad to take the dog to the vet, as after doing a fair amount of reading the day of the seizure, I found that seizures lasting five minutes or longer could be an emergency (brain damage). Since my mom's gone, I'm left with my dad, who won't take our dog to the vet because he seems fine.

I will say, our dog does appear fine. He's his usual meandering, grumpy self. The only potential sign I've noticed is that he seems lethargic, but that may be due to him still recovering from the seizure (I read that it takes about a week for a dog to bounce back) and the fact that my mom isn't around (all the dogs in the house love her, including the one that had the seizure).

I still want to take the dog to the vet because there could be something that isn't visible or noticeable, and simply because almost all articles I've read have basically said ""A SEIZURE LASTING FIVE MINUTES OR LONGER IS AN EMERGENCY. TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY."" So I want to.

Obviously, it hasn't happened immediately because the seizure was *three days ago,* but I'm getting restless and want to know if there's something I can do. I can't take him to the vet myself because I'm in my teens and don't have my own resources for that (I would have done it the day of if I could).

607,dogs,"

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

It will be my first dog- I have always had cats. I do live with my boyfriend and his dog (beagle) so I have experience from that but she‚Äôs not technically mine. I also worked at a pet supply store for a few years where I learned a ton about care, training, nutrition and supplies for dogs and cats. Helped train this dog as well as friends dogs with positive reinforcement but I‚Äôm still a beginner 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]

I will only adopt through a rescue, I‚Äôm not open to breeders

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Honestly, all the attributes of a cat but in dog form. An ideal dog would be sensitive, not super energetic but likes to walk or run around the neighborhood sometimes. A couch potato with a little bit of play. Smart. Likes to just chill most of the time. Not prone to a lot of barking/super loud barking, friendly and cuddly but not so clingy that they‚Äôre glued to you at all times. Also not prone to excessive licking 


4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I‚Äôve been looking into greyhounds- there was a greyhound rescue that came into my work sometimes and I loved them. I like that they are sensitive/shy in the same way cats are, a little weird, and friendly. I know they‚Äôre also pretty laid back. They are also pretty quiet. I just like their vibe

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Other than basic house training, whatever my dog wants. If the dog wants to learn tricks or agility and has fun, I‚Äôll do that but it‚Äôs not necessary 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

No, they‚Äôd just be a companion 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Not a ton of intense training but I do work from home and would like to just relax and hang out with them during the day

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

About an hour walk or run daily (or less if the dog doesn‚Äôt want it). Otherwise I would play indoors and in the yard with them throughout the day. Open to dog parks but don‚Äôt need them 

9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

Fine with trimming nails, cleaning ears and brushing at home, but don‚Äôt want a ton of fur upkeep otherwise 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for?

Open to all sizes

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Shedding is fine, a little bit of slobber is ok. Would prefer very little barking or quiet barking

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

A balance. Sometimes cuddly but also has to be ok with some personal space 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Mostly do it‚Äôs own thing

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

Friendly, not aggressive but also not super jumpy or loud 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No, and this dog would be living with a another dog

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Just excessive barking

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Not often, we work from home but might occasionally go out for 4 hours max

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

They all love dogs, would occasionally feed, walk and let this dog out when needed

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

A senior beagle that does well with other dogs. I also have fish. Might get a cat years down the road 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? 

Austin, TX USA and no

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Winter 40-70f, summer 85-100+f

608,dogs,"*Plato* is a dog that I rescued back in February of 2021. He's about 2 years old, and is about *40% shepherd, 20% husky, and 20% mix of various other breeds*. Before I get into the details, I'll summarize the issues we've been facing since the day we got him:

* Terrified of large inanimate objects. Cardboard boxes, shopping bags, moving furniture, waving flags, backpacks, cars &amp; trucks, you name it. 
* Does not care for food. He's pretty indifferent-to-occasionally enthusiastic about treats, but food, especially kibble, is something he really won't eat unless he's starving. When we were on his previous food, it wouldn't be abnormal for him to go 2-3 days without eating. 
* The weather outside affects his mood severely. Windy? Cowers in the bathroom. Snowing or raining? Knows something is going on out there and grows anxious/depressed. 
* Certain sounds completely freak him out. The sound of a bag rustling or a raincoat falling off of a coat hook make him want to run away as quick as possible. 

The list goes on, but those are the primary issues we've been dealing with. We've had him evaluated at the vet many, many times, and he is extremely (physically) healthy. Perfect weight, perfect dental hygiene, and no worms/disease. He's a rescue, so we're unsure about his past, but vets &amp; trainers have speculated that he has some sort of trauma from his upbringing (we got him at 4 months, so there are 4 months of unknown history).

I really feel like I'm at my wits end, and I'm losing ideas and my hope is dwindling for recovery from this terrible anxiety he suffers from. Last May we moved from a more rural, off the highway spot to a more city-like part of town. We moved here specifically because the apartment was so big, and he'd have all the room in the world to roam and play. And yet, he just sits in the bathroom all day and looks miserable. He's scared to leave the apartment, even on extremely quiet days and nights. If I get him outside, he wants to go right back inside after he's done his business. He used to love sniffing around - he still will, but it seems that his main task is to get out and get right back in ASAP. 

Me and my partner try really hard to accommodate for him, and make sure that we're doing everything in our power to encourage a happy and healthy lifestyle for him. He gets 1-2 walks a day, 3-4 bathroom trips, goes to day care, the dog park, and every once and a while we get together with our dog-owning friends and let them play for hours. 

We've tried 10+ different dog kibbles, and every trick in the book: we mix with oils, broths, heat the food up in the microwave, mix with wet food, etc., he just will not eat on a regular basis. One thing we found recently is that he has a better appetite for wet food, but he can still be pretty picky. He also *will not eat without both me and my partner in the room*. If we give him food and then leave, there is a 0% chance he'll even touch the bowl. This I understand - dogs are pack animals, and he feels comfortable with his pack. It can just be incredibly frustrating and confusing for a dog to not want to eat food... All the dogs I've ever known will eat all the food they can get.

We got him a thunder jacket, and he seems to be alright with it, but I don't notice a substantial difference in his anxiety when I strap it onto him during a stressful situation. He's currently on *fluoxetine* for his anxiety, and honestly, I do notice a pretty big difference. Where before he'd be completely resistant to his fears, he's now opening up a bit and seems slightly more confident. Though, I believe we've reached the threshold of what the medication can offer. It's ""working"", but he's still anxious enough to where it's a problem.

We just had a trainer come over to our place to help evaluate Plato and give us tips and tricks to waning his anxiety and making him feel more comfortable &amp; less scared. Super helpful session, but I can only hope his advice works (letting him sit and observe high-stress areas in low-stress spots, desensitization via. high value treats, affirmation, etc). The trainer even suggested that maybe another pet in the house could help, so we've been thinking about getting a kitten. Could this all be because of loneliness? I have my doubts, but I do think having another critter roaming around with him would be beneficial. 

I want to add: Plato is an amazing dog. He is highly intelligent, super affectionate and cuddly, and loves being around people. Aside from these problems that affect his mental health, I really could not ask for a better dog. 

Any advice? Any stories about similar dogs you may have or know of? I feel super alone in dealing with this, as all of our friends and family's dogs are completely functional and happy... I really dislike people pitying him. He's such a good boy, and it's a shame people have to see him as a nervous wreck. Any &amp; all help is appreciated.

The Embark tests came back, and they were interesting - and not what the shelter thought.

Her dog is 68.6% Anatolian Shepherd, 17.9% Great Pyrenees, and 13.5% Maremma Sheepdog.

What intrigues me is that there are so few breeds contributing - and that all three breeds are very similar in so many ways - all of them are large livestock guardian/shepherd dogs.

I wonder if this indicates that her dog was the result of an intentional breeding? As opposed to an accidental breeding?

If she had in fact been a Great Pyrenees/Golden mix, I would have guessed that a Great Pyrenees or Golden Retriever had jumped the fence when a bitch from the other breed was in heat.

What intrigues me about this mix is that all three breeds are very similar, and that there are only three. Most of the time when I see Embark results for a mixed breed shelter dog, I see lots more breeds in the mix, and the breeds are functionally unrelated.

It‚Äôs also interesting that each set of grandparents consisted of a purebred Anatolian Shepherd and a Great Pyrenees/Maremma Sheepdog mix.

We‚Äôll never know - the dog was a stray.

But I wonder if this dog was the result of someone‚Äôs attempt to create a hybrid large livestock guardian/shepherd dog. It may be noteworthy that the dog passed all of Embark‚Äôs genetic tests - including the 3 breed specific tests for Great Pyrenees.

I also wonder how reliable genetic breed detection is when you start looking at very obscure breeds.

I am definitely starting to feel a bit burnt out. One puppy has separation anxiety, as in break out and destroy a whole desktop pc anxiety (that's literal, at his previous owners home he did exactly that) and one has some slight resource gaurding issues. We definitely allow growling, and have never tried to discourage her from growling, yet she still will go straight to snapping at her brother (diff litters, not related at all fyi) immediately when he even gets close, mind you this is entirely random as well. Just today it was a bone that hadn't been causing any issues, yesterday she randomly went for him snarling and snapping cause he got close to her empty food bowl (we put them up outside of meal times and always have) She never has shown an issue when he is interested in her bowl, but ig last night she decided she wasn't done licking it.

I will say, the gaurding issue is manageable and we have been doing exactly that. Feed in separate rooms, high value treats put away, thankfully those are the only things she gaurds.

On the bright side, the younger of the two FINALLY asked to go out by pawing the door. Due to him being crated for 8-9 hours a day then again at night when he was just 8-10 weeks old (previous owners, im home all day so that never happens) he had no clue about potty training.

623,dogs,"I‚Äôve searched for this but tend to get a lot of results regarding potty training for very young ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù pups.

I recently moved from a house with a backyard to a condo. When she had the yard I let my pup (8 month old golden retriever) out whenever she asked to, and to be honest didn‚Äôt pay too much attention to her pee/poo schedule after she was potty trained. Sometimes she had to go and other times she just wanted to run around or chill outside.

Now that I‚Äôm in a high-rise I need to take her on a 30+ min walk to pee. It is a pain when the weather is bad and it‚Äôs cold so I‚Äôve got it down to 4 walks. She is still figuring out city living and takes a while to find a spot. I hope potty breaks speed up in the future.

I‚Äôve been adjusting our schedule as we settle into the new place and trying to figure out something that works. Her current schedule is:

- 7am Long walk (approx 45 min, she usually does a poo here) followed by breakfast at home around 8am
- 11:30am Short walk (approx 30 min) - she does her post-breakfast poo here
- 4pm Short walk (approx 20-30 min)
- Dinner some time between 6:30-7:30pm
- A final short walk some time between 9-10pm

Anyways, my question is this: Is the gap between her breakfast/dinner and potty break too long? Sometimes she will start whining about 15 min to half an hour after eating. I can‚Äôt tell if she has to pee/poo or if she just wants to go outside for fun. A lot of search hits say pups need to go ~30 min after eating but I think this is for much younger pups?

Also she eats half her daily kibble on her walks, the other half is her breakfast/dinner in her crate.

-adding frozen (thawed when served) raw stella and chewy puppy food
-adding all varieties of canned wet food, freeze dried raw food, broth, yogurt, etc. at best he will lick at it until just the kibbles are left 
-putting the kibbles and freeze fried raw food in the food processor to change the texture a bit but he still won‚Äôt eat much more than a couple bites or lick at it.

631,dogs,"Hi there, 

Bit of background: She is about 6 years old and we got her from a rehoming shelter 1.5 years ago. Before that she was in a larger ""kill shelter"" and before that she was likely living on her wits alone in the wild. At first she was very scared, and it was difficult to approach her at home. She would be very shaky, and pant excessively. She would make a weird kind of cooing noise if we got too close for her. But over time she has improved greatly and we can pet he freely, she jumps on the sofa for treats, she loves her walks and eats well. She has no interest in toys and is indifferent to other dogs. My wife spends all day with her and they are especially close.

When we have had to go out and leave her, rarely for more than a couple of hours, she usually soends the time lying on her bed and sleeping, and seems quite content. However, when we get home she becomes very shaky and seems quite scared to be honest. She usually snaps out of it in 5-10 mins and goes back to normal, but recently she has gone into her crate a couple of times, and she only used to do that when very scared, ie. when a stranger visits. She actually hadn't been in there for about a year due to her improvement.

Does anyone have any ideas of what she is going through, or advice advice as to how to improve things? I'd be grateful to hear what people have to say.

As an add-on, she is always uncontrollably shaky when we go to the vet or the groomer, but she let's them do what they have to, and never bites or even barks.

So she barks at black people. And I mean barks, snarls, and goes audibly nuts. A black person can walk right up to us and pet her problem free, so it's not an aggression thing. But it does present a problem when there 12 people at home depot around us watching her frolic happily, until the one black person in the store walks by and she goes nuts...

I'll just put my head down and if I don't make eye contact maybe you can't see me"".... Fortunately, he laughed it off and had humor about it. Now even with her going nuts, he could've just walked up normal and pet her, and she'd stop.    

I've had this occurrence repeat more and more lately; with all the controversy ongoing right now, this really isn't good. She's raised around people of varying colors, backgrounds... She's diverse in terms of her world experiences. But she just insists on barking at black people. And it seems like each time she does it, theres just even more whites around she doesn't bark at.

We strongly recommended against it, and gave the reasoning that we didn't think an ""average"" dog owner would be ready for the challenge of 2 dogs, one of which had behavioral problems.  This sparked the conversation with them of what an ""average"" owner looks and acts like, and what they expect dog ownership to be like. So I'm curious what y'all think the average dog owner is like. To be clear, NOT the average dog owner on this subreddit (I think we can agree we tend go a bit above and beyond for our dogs here). I'm curious because it sets the tone for what I expect when talking to another dog owner about training, behavior management, etc. The criteria we gave our acquaintances was:

  
1. Doesn't want to walk a dog at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week.

2. Not interested in training dogs beyond ""sit"" and ""lay down"".

3. Assumes most dogs' behavioral issues can be solved quickly (ie days or a couple weeks, rather than months or longer).

4. Assumes dogs have an innate understanding of human expectations.

5. Hasn't experienced significant issues with a dog before (ie separation anxiety, aggression, reactivity).

6. Expects dogs to naturally know how to relax when the humans want to relax.

667,dogs,"My puppy is almost two years old this March, and she‚Äôs a cute 4 pounds. Potty training has been next to impossible with her, and I have genuinely tried every suggestion. Hoping for new insight and new suggestions, I‚Äôm at such a loss I‚Äôm on the verge of accepting that my dog is just never going to be potty trained. I hate to stereotype dogs but I swear there is something about small dogs and potty training. Before we begin, I‚Äôd like to state that the vet laughed in my face when I asked if she needed to be taken out more because she has a smaller bladder, he said that‚Äôs a myth and not a real thing. Also to note: I am ONLY using positive reinforcement and won‚Äôt be open to any other methods. 

Things I‚Äôve tried/considered: 
- Taking her out every 30 min, then every hour, then every 2 hours, etc. Slowly building time up over the months. This actually worked for a while but she caps herself at hour 4. She could hold it for about 4 hours and anything longer she had no issue going inside. 
- Got a doorbell and attempted to teach her how to signal me when she needed to go outside. 
- Leashing her at all times. I had her leashed while I ate dinner, walking around the house, going to the bathroom, changing, you name it. She had no issue going right in front of me on a leash lol. Though I was catching her in the act, it didn‚Äôt really seem to do much. She‚Äôs always with me anyways whether leashed or not. 
- Blocking off certain parts of the apartment. I‚Äôm in a studio so there wasn‚Äôt really much to block off but I tried that too, truly did nothing. 
- When I work from home, I pretty much keep her on the bed with me the entire time so I am watching her and know she‚Äôs not sneaking off somewhere. This works, but this doesn‚Äôt apply to when I have friends over and it‚Äôs embarrassing when she sneaks off somewhere to pee. 
- She is kenneled at all times when I leave to prevent accidents inside and she does not have accidents in her kennel. I have tried letting her free roam when I am gone, but she actually prefers to be in her kennel so we do that. 
- She is able to hold it for 14 hours at night. I am fully aware that when they are sleeping vs awake this is different as she is active awake and will not be able to hold it as long. But I do believe she is fully capable of holding it more than 4 hours during the day! 
- At my wits end I introduced puppy pads and put one down. She actually started to only go on the puppy pads, and I was shocked. Instead of accidents everywhere inside, she is preferring to go on a puppy pad in the closet. My sister told me this method was horrible but I‚Äôm at such a loss. Should I slowly over time move the puppy pad until it is at my patio door and then start placing it outside? That‚Äôs my only other idea. This also makes me think of how cats use litter boxes and maybe I accept my life that my dog uses puppy pads. It‚Äôs at least better than going on my new rug. She loves to pee on the puppy pad but rarely poops on them. She is driving me up the wall!

Okay so I have two pups. A dachshund and a blood hound. The weenie is super chill and kinda does his own thing and while he loves and craves attention he's super fine just doing his own thing. He listens very well and goes into his crate for bed time, goes to the bathroom when told, etc. 



The bloodhound is the big issue. He is constantly super needy. If he isn't LITERALLY ON TOP OF YOU 24/7 he will cry, whine, throw fits, or destroy everything. We have tried everything save for getting a professional trainer. We've tried ignoring him, putting him in timeout, giving treats when we leave the house or toys as a distraction. Everything but he still whines unless you are with him 24/7. 


At first I thought it was my small apartment that was an issue because he is a big dog so when I moved I got a place with a great backyard.........he hates the backyard now. He views ""playtime"" outside as a punishment or that i'm abandoning him. The biggest problem is how he'll bully the weenie (cowboy is my weenies name and Chief is my Bloodhound) to get attention. If you pet Cowboy even just a headpat; Chief will shove him out the way to get at you. 



I don't spank, hit, or do anything like that to my dogs and they were raised by me from almost birth so it's not that Chief dealt with an abusive home. I don't know what to do because he constantly acts like we're tormenting him by just living. I also play with both of them all the time. I'll play fetch with Chief for hours but it's never ever ever enough. If I go to the bathroom he cries, go to the shower he cries, lord forbid I leave the house.

I adopted a rescue dog (maltipoo, 2-3 years old) about 6 days ago. 
She has some wildlife experience and foster care experience as well. 
Overall, she‚Äôs very sweet and kind, but she‚Äôs less interested in what humans are saying, and I think it‚Äôs because she had lived in the wilderness, and she developed her own survival tactics. 
She‚Äôs smart so she understands what it‚Äôs allowed and what‚Äôs not. But just don‚Äôt trust me a lot yet. 

On her first and the second day, she was really friendly and she wanted to sleep with me on my bed, and I let her sleep on my bed. I thought it would help her and me to build some bonding and trust in that way. 

Then I saw she was sitting on my bed without humans next to her, and when I commanded her to come down, she wouldn‚Äôt listen. I got little worried if she would be attached to the bed, not me. 

So now I let her sleep in her crate in my room. She‚Äôs doing fine with it, but in the middle of night, she comes to my bed side and wagging her tails to appeal that she wants sleep on my bed with me. So far, I said no to her, and she will go back to her crate. 

My ultimate goal is once she decompresses completely and be obedient and bonded with me, I want to allow her to sleep on my bed with me. 
But for now, I don‚Äôt want to spoil her first even before she knows the rules of my family and before she builds a complete trust and bonding with me. Also, I‚Äôm concerned if she will develop a separation anxiety. 
On the other hand, I‚Äôm worried if I‚Äôm missing the chance to build up the bonding with her by letting her sleep with me. 

Am I doing it right? Like limit her access for now and open it up later?

698,dogs,"**I.Introduction**

Dogs are known for their strong sense of smell and intuition, and they often seem to have a sixth sense about people. If you‚Äôve ever had a dog that growled or barked at someone you later found out was untrustworthy, you know what I‚Äôm talking about. But how do dogs recognize a bad person? Is it purely based on their sense of smell, or do they use other cues as well? In this article, we‚Äôll explore how dogs recognize a bad person and how you can protect your furry friend from potential harm.

**I.Dogs sense of smell**

Dogs have a much stronger sense of smell than humans, with up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses compared to our measly 6 million. This incredible sense of smell allows dogs to detect even faint odors that we can‚Äôt. One example of this is pheromones, which are chemical signals that are released by animals and can indicate fear or aggression. Dogs can detect these pheromones and use them to gauge the mood and intentions of other animals and people.

But a dogs sense of smell isn‚Äôt just limited to detecting pheromones. They can also use their sense of smell to detect changes in a person‚Äôs behavior. For example, when a person is feeling anxious or stressed, their body releases adrenaline and other stress hormones. Dogs can smell these hormones and may become more alert or cautious in response. Similarly, if a person is lying or trying to deceive someone, their body may release chemicals that indicate their heightened level of stress or anxiety. A dog may be able to smell these changes in behavior and respond accordingly.

In addition to detecting pheromones and changes in behavior, dogs can also use their sense of smell to identify specific people. They can remember the unique scent of their human family members and even distinguish between identical twins by their scent. This ability to recognize individual scents can be helpful in situations where a dog needs to differentiate between friendly and unfamiliar people.

Overall, a dogs sense of smell is an important tool they use to recognize and respond to different people and situations. Whether it‚Äôs detecting pheromones, changes in behavior, or individual scents, a dogs nose is an incredible tool that allows them to navigate the world around them.

**III.Dogs intuition and body language**

In addition to their incredible sense of smell, dogs are also skilled at reading body language and vocal cues. They can pick up on subtle changes in posture, facial expressions, and tone of voice that may indicate a person is untrustworthy or dangerous. For example, if a person is standing with their arms crossed and a scowl on their face, a dog may sense that this person is not approachable and may become wary or anxious in their presence. On the other hand, if a person is smiling and has an open posture, a dog may be more likely to approach them and interact in a friendly manner.

But it‚Äôs not just their ability to read body language that allows dogs to recognize a bad person. They may also use their instincts and past experiences to determine if a person is a threat. If a dog has had a negative encounter with someone in the past, they may be more wary of them in the future. This is especially true if the encounter was particularly traumatic or if the person displayed aggressive or threatening behavior.

Overall, a dogs intuition and ability to read body language and vocal cues are important tools they use to navigate the world around them. By paying attention to these cues, dogs can make informed decisions about who they can trust and who they need to be cautious around.

**IV.** **How to protect your dog**

While it‚Äôs important to trust your dogs judgment and allow them to use their senses and intuition to recognize a bad person, it‚Äôs also important to take steps to protect them from potential harm. Here are a few tips for keeping your dog safe:

* Keep your dog leashed and under control when in public: This can help prevent your dog from approaching strangers or getting into potentially dangerous situations.
* Socialize your dog from a young age: By exposing your dog to a variety of people and environments from a young age, you can help them feel more comfortable and confident around new people.
* Pay attention to your dogs body language and behavior around new people: If your dog seems anxious or uncomfortable around someone, it may be best to keep your distance.
* Consider training your dog in basic obedience and protective commands: Teaching your dog commands such as ‚Äústay,‚Äù ‚Äúcome,‚Äù and ‚Äúleave it‚Äù can help you maintain control and keep them safe in potentially dangerous situations. You may also want to consider training in protective commands such as ‚Äúguard‚Äù or ‚Äúwatch.‚Äù

By following these precautions and paying attention to your dogs behavior, you can help keep them safe from harm and ensure they have a happy, healthy life.

**V.Conclusion**

In conclusion, dogs have a strong sense of smell and intuition that allows them to recognize a bad person before we do. Their ability to detect pheromones, changes in behavior, and individual scents, combined with their skill at reading body language and vocal cues, makes them excellent at sensing danger and protecting their human family. It‚Äôs important to trust your dogs judgment and pay attention to their behavior around new people. But it‚Äôs also important to take steps to protect them, such as keeping them leashed and under control in public, socializing them from a young age, and considering training in basic obedience and protective commands.

707,dogs,"I have a female keeshond (roughly 35 lbs) and we were taking our morning walk through our neighborhood. Typical suburban area. From way over on the other side of the street, this GIANT un-neutered pitball charges at us, growling. I grab my dog off the pavement and start shouting, ""NO! NO!"" I'm afraid that if I run, he'll chase us and become more agitated. I'm also a young woman, so there's no way I'll be able to put up any kind of fight. Finally, the owner gets her dog and apologizes, and I can safely get the hell away. 


For about a minute I'm speed-walking my ass off AND THEN ANOTHER DOG (a standard poodle) runs through like three yards to get to my dog. At this point I have had enough. I'm crying, and I scream, ""What is wrong with you people?! Get your dog!"" This owner, another woman, tells me to ""shut the fuck up,"" ""you're being so crazy."" Meanwhile, her disobedient poodle is now about a quarter mile from his yard and he won't listen to her recall, and I guess she's too stubborn to run over and grab him.

708,dogs,"I am going to try and keep things short, but I rescued what I am assuming a pit mix from the side of the road a few months back. I tried for months to look for his owners, but couldn't find them. So, after having him vetted I ended up with another dog. He is about 50lbs, and I also have a 25lb shih tzu and a 7lb yorkie. Brody, the rescue, has been a really great dog so far. Extremely smart, sweet, playful, not destructive and doesn't relieve himself in the house. We've become quite fond of him in the last 4 months or so. 

He has been getting along with our other dogs too, he tries to play with them all of the time but they are too small and not very playful in general but he does seem to like them. He also sits on the couch/bed next to them frequently and shares toys with no problem. Our shih tzu Bentley is starting to get up there in age, and can get a bit cranky at little things. If Brody gets up in his face or swats at him to play, Bentley will growl or lightly snap and walk away. He isn't aggressive and doesn't bite, he just isn't afraid to tell someone when he is sore or doesn't want to be bothered. Brody has never reacted to this and always just goes back to playing with his toys like nothing even happened. He's great with the other two, shares toys and food no problem. Because of his super laid back behavior and indifference towards our senior's crankiness, we've slowly started to gain trust in Brody. We've noticed he is very reactive on walks, but for some reason he is fine around strangers/dogs if it's in a setting like a pet store, grooming parlor or vet office. He is only reactive on walks and sometimes when strangers come by the house. Otherwise, we have never seen him growl or even curl a lip at anyone or anything while at home. A total sweet goofball unless he is on a walk which we are actually making slow progress with. 

But recently, I've noticed a pattern in some recent behavior that came to a sudden head this morning. Our two original dogs always sleep in the bed with us, but for some reason when Brody would try to get in bed with us at night too, he would get comfortable and then frustrated very quickly and want to go sleep on his own. Something about people shifting next to him or jostling him while he is getting comfortable or trying to sleep seems to bother him. Ok, no problem. We have a couple of dog beds and a couch available to him, and he usually alternates between them so he has plenty of space at night. 

Eventually though as we started to bond more, he started wanting to sit next to me on the couch in the evenings instead of lying on the floor which I thought was great! But if he is pressed up against me on the couch and I have to shift or move for whatever reason, he immediately lets out a grumble and gets up to sit elsewhere. One time, that grumble sounded a little more like an actual growl until one day, he straight up barked at me before getting up off the couch to go sit on the floor. It will be simple things, like he will have his back curled against my side and I will have to shift my weight to get comfortable, or lean forward to grab my drink off the coffee table, and he immediately gets frustrated and grumbles and moves elsewhere even though he was the one who wanted to snuggle next to me in the first place. This has all been specifically towards me and my partner though, not the other dogs. 

Lately, Brody has been wanting to try and snuggle with me on the bed in the mornings which again, I thought was great progress. I have the day off today so I was sitting in bed on my phone with the other 2 dogs when Brody came up to lie next to all of us and take a morning nap. He actually stretched out and laid right up against me and fell asleep, which has only happened once before. It was really sweet for a while. I tried to stay super still so I wouldn't piss him off and make him move, but our older dog Bentley shifted his weight for whatever reason and before I knew it, Brody's snoring turned into a full-out growl and he snapped at Bentley. He didn't make any contact, but he got right in his face and barked/snapped a few times before I was able to register what was happening and got him off the bed. Brody went back to his usual sweet self immediately after and went on the couch to sleep instead. 

This is the first time he has shown any sign of anything other than playfulness or indifference towards our other dogs and to be honest, it made me scared. Bentley is old, and Brody could seriously hurt him if he wanted to. I don't even want to think about what would happen if he wanted to snap at our Yorkie. Other than this, he has been nothing but a PERFECT dog. Seriously amazingly sweet and well-behaved. I just don't understand why he is getting so irritable when he is tired? I love all three of them desperately, but I am heartbroken at the idea of having to rehome Brody, and even more heartbroken to think of what might happen if he snaps again. Should I keep Brody off the furniture or something from now on? I should also mention that he has met our in-laws little dog when we went to visit for Christmas, and their dog full on tried to attack Brody and bit his legs and Brody did absolutely nothing but look at them like ""uhhhh.....ok lol"" and just ignored him. Obviously we kept them separate for the rest of their visit (I didn't agree to Brody meeting their dog because I knew their dog is a little asshole to begin with but my fiance insisted) but I was really impressed that Brody had absolutely no reaction. This behavior is coming out what seems to be exclusively in the early mornings or in the evenings when it's time to wind down and he is groggy.

I would love to hire a professional trainer, but to be honest, I wasn't expecting to get a third dog and I am already stretched thin financially. I really only kept him because he seemed to be extremely sweet and well-behaved, I couldn't find anyone to adopt him personally, and I would hate to have taken him off the street just to turn around and throw him in a shelter. He deserves a good home. However, if it comes down to needing to rehome him for the safety of my little ones, I will do so.

709,dogs,"Planning in the near future (in period of two years) on getting a puppy (not a first time owner, had GSD before, she was amazing with people, but had a strong drive for prey, the only time i actually saw her playing was when sausage dog befriended her, but 99% of the time she would try to chase everything what moved in our backyard, thank god we managed to handle her so she never hurt a soul (except for wasps)). I own 3 cats (or as a cat owner would say they own me üòÑ), one of them grew up with east european shepherd mix and rough haired collie, she acts like alpha, doesn't like mess at home and if other kitties are getting out of line she intervenes and stops their rampage at home. I remember the dogs following her around and sometimes being afraid to go through doors if she sat on the entrance, she managed to put them in their place too. She never claws, she just does jump scares for any kind of animal. And somehow they manage to acknowledge that the little cat (compared to the collie size) is in charge. Another two are super friendly cats and they love to play together (a female and a male), both are super sociable and love going into the contact, the only issue i had saw before, if my cat gets barked, he doesn't get what dog wants from him with those loud barks (even if it is a playful one). So the first question would be:

1. Which breeds would possibly work ( i know about bernese mountain dogs, golden retrievers and collies), energy needs are not an issue as long as they are comparable to GSD.
2. Which gender dog would be more gentle with the bunch like that, does gender makes any differences at all? (from cat perspective there are two female cats and one male, all of them are fixed).
3. How to properly introduce (cats are all grown ups, 3-5 years old, the oldest one grew up with dogs), and how exactly slow introduction works, maybe you could give some examples?

Hi, we just got a golden retriever puppy. He is 3 months old now. We have a small fenced yard. I am thinking to install a dog door to let him have a potty outside of the room. I currently have three options. I need your help and give me advice.

Option 1: Install a wall-mount dog door to the back yard. I have only one spot suitable to install the dog door. But I found a stud in that location using a studs finder. I do not know if it is a bearing stud or not. If I install it here, I have to cut the stud.

Option 2: Install a dog door on the exterior door to the backyard. The thing is our door is a non-sliding glass door. It will be very difficult to cut the glass to install the dog door.

A few days ago we were walking down the road and he‚Äôs always good passing people.

I asked her if he touched her hand and he said no he tugged my sleeve. It wasn‚Äôt even a yank. It was just a sleeve tug. I looked at him and he was just standing there and not even looking at her.  I apologized. I assumed he thought she was giving him food or a toy and that‚Äôs why he gave the sleeve a quick tug and let go immediately because he realized. His body signs didn‚Äôt seem vicious either and he was just chilling after that. I talked with the lady after that and he was fine, he didn‚Äôt do it again.

727,dogs,"Hi there,

I've actually never posted on Reddit before, so this is a first time thing haha. I need some other puppy/dog owners advice with our puppy, but I'll give some context beforehand. He's a 13 week old Cavapoo puppy (and is very adorable), we've had him for a week and a half now. He's already learned how to ""ring the bell"", ""sit"", and pee and poop outside. We're pretty proud of him, but he's still having accidents. 

I work from home, so I've been trying to take him out every hour, especially if he has some water (which we restrict his access to). He knows to go outside, and has been doing so pretty well. He only wakes us up once, which is at 7am, but when we try putting him back in his crate after he potties, he cries incessantly. We usually don't feed him until 8:30-9am so I don't think it's him being hungry, I think it's him wanting to be in bed with us (he's a very sweet and dependent puppy). The issue is, he usually poops outside at 7am, but then will poop again unexpectedly either 20, 30, or 40 minutes later inside our apartment. It's frustrating because we're not sure why he poops in that kind of interval, since he won't poop the rest of the day until after around 3pm. And although I said he knows the command ""ring the bell"" and will do it when I ask him to, he will never, ever go to the door by himself and ring it on his own. In fact, he usually gives no indication when he's about to go potty inside. He knows it's bad, because afterward, we put him in his crate for about 5 minutes as punishment and he stays quiet and sulks. Just to note, the way my apartment is laid out, the door is down the hallway and out of the view from the Livingroom, so I wonder if this has to do with his accidents since he may forget where the door is.  

Another issue I had with him was I took him outside to his designated peeing and pooping spot, but he did nothing. In fact, he starting chewing on rocks and sticks and running around all hyper instead of using the bathroom. That was weird to me, because he never did that before really. He would typically go out, sniff around some, then use the bathroom. I took him back inside and then he RANG THE BELL ON HIS OWN right when we walked back inside. I was so excited, so I praised him, gave him a treat, then picked him up and took him downstairs and outside (we live on the second floor in an apartment and he's still too scared to go down the stairs, but he can go up them!) back to his spot. Bad news, he just ran around and tried chewing on rocks and sticks again.... so I assumed he was fine. The second I took him back inside, he peed right in front of me. That's where I'm really confused, since I literally took him out twice. 

The only issue I can think of is that we give him too much freedom, but most times when he's running around and playing, I'm keeping my eye on him. I also create a little play pen around my work desk so that he can only play in my view. 

Please help! We're not sure if we're doing something wrong, or if he's still too young to know the connection between ringing the bell and going outside. Thanks for the advice!",Need advice on 13 week old puppy!,1673621825,3125,33,607,7
728,dogs,"I've had Bruce since he was fifteen weeks old. I've always had pet insurance in case anything went wrong and a couple of times it was helpful, but there's so many exclusions, most of the time any vet visits aren't covered or only portions are, etc.

Now he's almost 11 (big golden) and he is getting older. His insurance is very expensive and frankly I'm not super stoked about extending his life just because I can make an insurance company pay for it - I wouldn't want him to suffer through huge medical ordeals just to get a few more months with him. As much as that kills me to say it. He's totally healthy right now and there's no reason to think anything will happen any time soon, but...

The vet just said that I should force her to eat her medicated canned food, tried that and she just spits it out, tried mixing it with her more fav dog food but she can tell and still won't eat it and now she doesn't want to eat her fav canned food anymore.

740,dogs,"Background as to why I‚Äôm considering importing a puppy: 

I‚Äôm from Hong Kong where there aren‚Äôt any reputable breeders around. If you google breeders, you‚Äôll only see Craigslist ads and rescue shelters. The only places you can get a dog from are pet shops and ofc shelters. 

Also, a lot of puppy mills are operating under the loophole of hobby breeding here. I‚Äôve had friends who‚Äôve purchased puppies for 40,000hkd - 60,000 hkd (5,100 USD - 7,600 usd) &lt; (this is the average cost for a dog here) from pet shops and they‚Äôve turned out unhealthy with defects.

Our first option was to adopt one from a shelter, however, we haven‚Äôt been able to find a small sized dog. Recently, there‚Äôs been a rescue of a dog (Pomeranian) hoarding case, which we almost went for. But, looking at the dogs, they were clearly inbred as some of the dogs have cleft noses. 

Also, the adoption process has been unsuccessful for my partner and I as we aren‚Äôt married. Although we have good income, recently moved to a dog friendly part of the city and have flexible working hours, the interview process goes back to square 1 due to us not being married yet.

So, we found a breeder called Korea Premium Puppy that ships puppies internationally. With the dogs ranging from 1500 usd to 2000 usd excluding shipping, we‚Äôd be saving money to put towards pet insurance. They provide with a health check certificate. And the flight duration is shorter compared to other countries. Has anyone imported puppies from abroad? Any recommendations? Any red flags ?

746,dogs," TLDR: is it possible to leash train a traumatized dog that does not respond to treats due to being spoiled?

A few years ago, my uncle adopted a border collie named Chip from an animal shelter. Chip was rescued from an abusive situation and was extremely fearful during the first few weeks/months. He is doing better now when inside the confines of the house and yard but I still feel bad for Chip. He's quite young and still very active up to the point that my uncle can't handle him (my uncle is 70 years old). Also, my uncle spoils Chip so much (gives him a steak, etc.) that treats have no effect on him and cannot be used for training. When giving Chip a bone he buries it in the yard so he has nothing to chew on except for a plushie (doesn't like chewy toys). So Chip has a lot of pent-up energy (jumps on my uncle, and barks a lot) that I want to help release by going on walks with him. This is proving to be quite the hassle.

My uncle told me that Chip was attacked during a previous walk and has trouble getting past the initial street (where another dog bit him) to get to the local park (once he's there he'll walk). Going for a walk goes something like this: once he sees the harness and leash he is scared and runs away, I've been able to 'fix' this by putting the harness on in a smaller room with a closed door and giving him a pep talk while doing so (no treats because he's spoiled and doesn't react to them when scared). Once the harness is on he'll happily walk out of the house a few feet from the front door and then stops and tries to go back to the door. When my uncle and family walk him, they'll drag him to the park (about 300 meters). I told them this will just reinforce his fear as he's now also being physically hurt while being scared.

When my uncle's not home I walk him and I stop when he pulls (completely ignoring him and looking at the direction I want us to go while standing completely still) and wait until he comes with me (then I give him a pep talk and pet him). This method eventually gets us to the park, but this can take very long and I get weird looks from the neighbors, making me feel like a criminal/dog abuser. Once we get to the park Chip will be aggressive towards other dogs and cyclists due to fear. I try to ignore / not get near any potential triggers. When we do pass another dog I will keep a short leash and keep walking, not saying anything while Chip is pulling and barking.

The last time I went out with Chip my uncle was still home. He was more scared/stubborn than usual due to knowing my uncle was home and started whining on the street. I did not want to reward this negative behavior so I stood still when he pulled, moved a bit forward when he came to me, stood still when he went back again, etc. This went on for quite a while (30+ minutes). A neighbor who was leaving in her car waited for a few minutes on the street corner, reversed slowly until parallel with us, rolled down her window, and asked me what I was looking for, to which I replied I am walking a dog. After that, I felt bad for causing a hindrance (Chip was whining louder and louder) and I picked him up (did not want to drag him) and carried him to the park.

I am unsure what I can do to improve Chip's well-being.

1. Should I keep trying to walk Chip even though he's scared of it?
2. Is my current method of walking Chip (standing still when pulling, pep talk when walking, and ignoring triggers) a good one? Can I improve it?
3. How can I reward Chip when he's facing his fears if he doesn't respond to treats?
4. How can I make my uncle realize that his habit of spoiling Chip is detrimental to Chip's well-being?
5. Should I give up on Chip, since he's my uncle's dog and I do not have any say in the situation?

This situation is weighing me down, I constantly think about Chip and feel sad for other dogs who are in a worse/similar situation.",Leash train uncle's spoiled dog,1673601629,3896,31,757,5

Problem is he's going to be boarded in a few days for the first time and I think the rabies tag needs to be on his collar. I tried adding it to his collar and he just stood there. This is something he does when I put clothes on him he doesn't like(which isn't often but being a small dog he needs extra layers in winter when on walks), he'll just stand there. He moved a bit but then just looked up at me with this look of pure distain -_-

So I was wondering how do I get him used to a big tag on his collar? I'm gonna ask them if it's necessary for him to wear it but I still think this is something I need to get him used to",Dog doesn't like rabies tag on his collar,1673592798,960,41,202,8
761,dogs,"5 days ago, I took in a foster dog without meeting him first. He‚Äôs 10-15 pounds heavier than they said he was. He jumps, claws, hits with his paws, doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äúno‚Äù and has yet to grasp it. He plays alright with my dog, but is constantly overpowering and pinning her and does not let her up, give her space or breaks, so I have to crate him for 15 minutes every time just to get him to calm down. He has separation anxiety and has pulled down curtains, blinds, my bed canopy. He tries to punch a hole in the actual window by slamming it with his paws when I step outside for 5-10 minutes to go to my car. He has pretty bad ground manners in general and has taken a running jump on a man at the dog park. He tries to dart out doors (successfully once). He dug up two plants in my garden, tore up some boxes and paper towels, and chewed on one of my shoes. He had one accident in the house (not super mad about this on its own.) The rescue is telling me I‚Äôm being unfair by telling them it‚Äôs not a match after 5 days (it will be 1 week when I take him back). I didn‚Äôt sign up to rehabilitate a dog. It was a trial foster to adopt. I told them what I was looking for, and I just can‚Äôt help but think they downplayed all of his behavior issues. He had already been with the rescue for at least a few weeks, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense that they were completely unaware.

Is this normal? Has anyone else had a less-than-great foster situation? Even without all the behavior issues, I don‚Äôt even think this dog would be a match for us personality-wise.

He is super gentle and LOVES everyone. He will always approach strangers and ask for pets and just rub himself all over them. He's never been aggressive with anyone

He's a bit different with other dogs however due to him being attacked twice when he was a puppy.

Anyway! I've always played rough with him. I nip him, I pinch him, I push him around, he comes after me and mouths my hand (never ever ever biting pressure). We can go back and forth for a long time and if he ever does become too aggressive (this has RARELY if ever happened), the playing stops immediately.

I sometimes get in his face and give him kisses and sometimes I sense that he doesn't like this, but he's never been remotely aggressive about it.

774,dogs,"I always had in my mind that I would only neuter my dog if he had behavioural problems that required stemming i.e. excessive humping or fighting. I thought not only that I might list him for stud one day, but also that it would just be nicer for him not to have to go through neutering just for the sake of it or because it‚Äôs ‚Äòthe norm‚Äô. 

For context, he has always been heavily socialised as there is a ‚Äòdog field‚Äô on my doorstep - yes literally on my doorstep, so every dog owner in the neighbourhood knows us and he has a bank of 20+ dogs (regulars) of all ages and breeds who he sees on a weekly basis. 

He is currently just over 18 months old and does not hump at all - however I am not sure on the aggression element and whether it requires fixing. He never had a fight in his first 12 months, other than being attacked unprovoked a couple of times by older, larger dogs with known behavioural issues. However in the last six months he‚Äôs had numerous altercations with other dogs, almost exclusively male. 

I have compiled some data for full context - out of the 27 dogs he sees most regularly, he gets along with 100% of the 7 females, but only gets along with 60% of the 20 males. Of the 8 he doesn‚Äôt get along with, there are 5 he can tolerate being around but might be on edge, and there are 3 he absolutely cannot be in the same space with. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a normal ratio or not. It seems bad to me but maybe the puppy stage blinded me a bit to the reality of adult dogs. 

One caveat is that this dog field, as mentioned, is on my doorstep. Therefore there is a chance he is seeing it as his territory, like a garden, and treating other dogs who enter accordingly as guests he can dominate rather than equals. 

As for his behaviour in other parks with dogs he doesn‚Äôt know so well - he sometimes does have to be pulled away for growling/squaring up, but it is usually a two-way thing rather than him going and blatantly inciting it. I‚Äôd say he only incites it 30% of the time, and the other 70% is either equal or incited by another dog. It is still quite a shock though because as I said, he never was involved in anything before 12 months. I also wonder if the scent of his testosterone is winding up the dogs who incite conflict with him. 

The other element to keep in mind in public parks is that he is usually on the leash when other dogs are around, and the leash impacts aggression a lot. He gets plenty of off-leash walks in quiet woods with no other dogs around, but in public parks he is too easily distracted. Now, the fact he is on the leash may be the issue, but of course taking it off is a risk as he could fight anyway and then I can‚Äôt pull him away as quickly. An example of how much the leash impacts aggression: remember I mentioned there are 5 males in the field he ‚Äòtolerates‚Äô? The leash is the tipping point. If it goes on around those dogs, things boil over immediately. 

Sorry if this has been long-winded but context is key for my questions.

1. How likely is it that being unneutered is the issue here? Is it indeed the testosterone? Is leash aggression more likely to be the issue? Is it a fear reaction related to the dogs that attacked him as a puppy? Is it territorial? Or is it just an adolescent hormonal phase that he is likely to grow out of in the next few months? There are so many factors that it‚Äôs hard to isolate what might be the cause.

2. To anyone who had such problems with their dog and went down the neutering route, did it stem the issues or not? I have seen a lot of research saying there‚Äôs no correlation, but a lot of anecdotal things saying there is. So it would be nice to just hear from real people on their experiences.

If if matters, my dog is a husky and shiba inu mix, 20kg - making him one of the larger and therefore maybe more intimidating dogs in the area. Certainly I have responsibility to ensure he is not bullying or harming other dogs that would struggle to defend themselves, or any other dogs of course.

I want above all to make the best decision for the safety and happiness of my dog and others. Thanks so much in advance.

I remember trying to have her sleep in my room when she was a puppy but she just wasn‚Äôt having it. A few weeks back, she randomly came into my room late at night and slept in there. This has now continued for a few weeks. She has been coming straight into my room without being prompted and would initially sleep through the night until around 6am when my dad got up for work, then she‚Äôd go back into their room. 

However, for the last few days she has been more unsettled in here and leaving my room much earlier. It was 6am, then 5am, then 4am and this morning she left for their room at 3am.

785,dogs,"Hi! I have been searching for a Labrador puppy for a few months now. Its meant to be a family dog, and I don't plan to breed. In looking at different breeders, I had a few questions that came to mind regarding phenotypic and genetic testing.:

I have seen at least one breeder that lists one of their dogs as an HNPK carrier. Is this irresponsible breeding? I'd imagine if the dog you breed it with is not a carrier, then there is no risk.

Is having a dilute copy of d-locus a negative indication of health of the dog? From what I read, its a dilute copy of the gene is suspected to come from cross-breeding with a Weimaraner. It makes sense that breeding dilute carriers is irresponsible to the breed standard, but does it create a health risk for the offspring? Is it otherwise bad?

Is normal OFA hips fine, or am I more likely to get a healthy puppy if the parents are Excellent? It seems like Good is the most common grade I've seen. I've also flipped through random OFA registrations and seen Good parents produce both Excellent and Fair offspring, so it seems like its not so black and white. I suppose I can also look up the dog's OFA hip lineage. I'm inclined that as long as the hips are cleared normal, there are much more important things to worry about.

Also as an aside, I never knew there are long-haired Labradors! Long-haired results from two recessive mutations in the FGF5 gene. Long-haired Labradors are considered pure bred but are not able to be shown.

\-----------

So your little furry friend ate your (or someone else‚Äôs) magic mushrooms. Dogs have been known to actually seek out these type of mushrooms, while cats sometimes just like being jerks and eat things they think they are not suppose to eat. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. This typically is not life threatening, however there has been numerous cases where a dog has eaten a poisonous mushroom, one of which may be perfectly fine for humans, and have unfortunately lost their life. The biggest risk is the amount they have consumed in relation to their body size. This is why no matter what you read, it is always recommended that you take them to the vet right away so they can begin detoxing your animal, and eliminating any chance of a life threatening condition.

Here is what to do if they have ingested Magic (Psilocybin) Mushrooms.

Step 1: You need to see a vet ASAP. Do not wait to see if they develop symptoms, because time is the enemy here. Once their body metabolizes enough, it‚Äôs more difficult to save them from life threatening conditions.

Step 2: If you are unsure if they have eaten Magic (Psilocybin) Mushrooms, and notice your dog or cat acting out of character, take them to the vet. Again, time is the enemy. It‚Äôs always best to be 100% safe.

Step 3: Try to bring a sample of what they may or may not have ingested. In some cases it can help the vet apply the best treatment. At the very least, tell the vet what type of magic mushroom, and how much, they ingested.

Step 4: Last but certainly not least: Be honest with your vet. If you know for certain they have ingested magic mushrooms, please do not just tell the vet they are showing symptoms or acting strange. Do not keep information from the vet. Be honest with them, it may save your pets life.

Symptoms to look out for.

* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Very slow or Very Rapid Breathing
* Lethargic
* Showing signs of pain (sitting or laying in unusual positions)
* Excessive Tiredness
* Unusually body movements or trouble with coordination. In other words, if it looks like they are drunk, this is a very serious symptom.

Is it ok to give my Dog or Cat Magic Mushrooms?

No.

We don‚Äôt even understand yet how psychedelics impact us, let alone dogs and cats. Magic mushrooms are powerful drugs, no question about it. As humans, when we take magic mushrooms we are first getting mentally prepared with the understanding that we are about to ‚Äútrip out‚Äù. Do you think your dog knows what‚Äôs about to happen to them?

If you feed your cat a slightly different food, they will most likely start vomiting like the girl from the exorcist. You imagine if they consumed something that alters a humans total neural network?

It‚Äôs never a good idea, even if you think you know your pet best and know they will love it. I doubt you will feel good if they die because you were negligent.

She's a mixed breed but has at least some Jack Russell terrier in the mix, should be 25 to 30 lbs when she's healthy. She's about 16 years old and completely deaf. She's significantly underweight and we're working with the vet to get her back to as healthy as possible. Other than the deafness, weight, and a sore spot at the base of her tail, she seems good. She's settled in with our other dogs, goes out on a leash without any complaints, and is very alert and active for her age. 

Anyway, now that I have an elderly, deaf dog, how in the world do I train her? I've had puppies and young adult rescues for years but they've all had hearing and vision and were still young and easily trained. She's at least house-trained and generally has good manners, but she doesn't signal to go out and she has zero recall that I can identify. I don't even care about ""tricks"", I just need basic commands. I'm gonna have to rework our fence since it was built for big dogs so she just walks right thru it and nothing I've tried gets her to come back (we have found that, being deaf, when she's focused on sniffing it's really easy to slip up on her and catch her, lol). 

So tell me Reddit, how can I make her retirement years comfortable without my life being a constant worry-fest about if she's gonna get hurt or worse because I can't communicate with her?","We've recently gotten a very old, completely deaf, neglected dog.

My dog has never once in his life displayed any sort of aggression towards a human before since I first brought him home at 7 weeks old.
Last night I allowed him into our bedroom to hang out with myself and the cats. I don't usually let him in the bedroom very often. Anyway, I fell asleep early on the couch in our room and my dog got on the couch and slept right next to me. My boyfriend came home around midnight and he instructed my dog ""off"" to remove himself from the couch. He didn't budge. He then told him ""crate"" but he still wouldn't move. When that didn't work my boyfriend reached for his collar to try to pull him off the couch and then I woke up to my dog growling and trying to snap at my boyfriends hand. As mentioned he's never shown any aggression to people even strangers or vets. 
I'm trying to understand what would cause this sudden behavior? He's been normal since last night but he wouldn't remove himself from staying next to me on the couch. My friend told me he was probably protecting me but I'm unsure?

She was very curious about my cat, and obviously as puppies do, would chase him or just go to play with him, much to the cat‚Äôs dissatisfaction. At first, when she was still super zoomy and still getting acclimated to the house, kept them separated as best we could ( their only interactions really being when I got home from work and the cat would be right by the door when we came in 

There was an incident where the cat scratched her and drew a little bit of blood, which at the time I didn‚Äôt blame the cat for because she got in his face and started barking. Now, however, she really just ignores him. If they‚Äôre on the same floor, she‚Äôll acknowledge his presence but just keep doing her own thing. BUT this cat is not only very scared-y but kinda stupid. He‚Äôll never run from the dog or go away‚Äî in fact he likes to come right up to her, sit, and hiss. This only occurs when we have her on a leash inside the house otherwise I dont trust either of them to not start something with the other (yet). 
We‚Äôre so close, its just that as soon as he hisses at her, she wnats to play. And if she wants to play, he gets more scared and more hissing, its a cycle, you get it.

I've wanted a dog all my life and now I finally have the time and money to give a dog all it needs to be happy. 

I got in contact with a responsible breeder (I looked into shelters, but didn't qualify to adopt) and I have now been on one visit. I felt everything went well,  I mostly focused on the puppies, interacted with them and also talked to her and asked questions about the puppies. 

After that she suggested that I visit again since I didn't pick a puppy that time, and I told her I really wanted to come visit again (idk if I seemed too desperate?) and we agreed that I would visit again after some weeks had passed. Since then I have only sent like 3 texts just to clarify some stuff that about which week she meant. 

Since then she hasn't responded to my one text for days which I find a bit concerning and I'm starting to mentally prepare myself for the fact that I may not get a puppy this time. On the other hand, she may just be busy as well.

He gets into a ""zone"" and isn't receptive towards any commands etc. so I just remove myself.

Lately (as of really this week) he has begun wanting to hump other dogs. Yesterday I went on a hike with a friend and their dog, and he basically tried to hump the other dog the entire time. It didn't help that the other dog was very docile (very minimal correction) but was also muzzled most of the time (because he eats poop and stuff - otherwise totally friendly). Today I dropped him off for a scheduled meet+greet/test at a local doggy daycare. They said he was overall really great, but he was trying to hump the other (stranger) dogs and they weren't liking it.

So, while I've had no specific timeline I always thought I would neuter him around the 1 year mark. I mostly hear/want to ensure his growth plates are finished as he will be a big adventure companion and I want him in the best reasonable health as possible.

In the past year or so, she has sadly lost her hearing from old age. One saving grace, though, is that she no longer hears the fireworks. However, she still has a strong reaction to thunder, so back to the previous tactics to try and calm her. 

I was wondering what senses are making her aware of the thunder - the smell, the vibrations of thunder, atmospheric pressure changes? And obviously I can't change these, but could anything make her less aware of them? Maybe it's completely dumb, but if it was smell changes, just using strong smelling candles of something to at least blur it out a bit?

I'm not even totally sure how exactly she can tell there's a storm, but if anyone has any ideas to make her less aware, that'd be fantastic.

I desperately cannot have my dog in a crate in cargo, she hates crates always has.

824,dogs,"My dog started refusing to eat her kibble around 6 months of age. She‚Äôd also refuse to eat breakfast, so we fed her once a day. Even then, on some days, she wouldn‚Äôt eat at all.

 Over the years, we tried so many things to get her to eat: wet food, hot water, meat scraps, etc. They sort of worked, but feeding her usually took a lot of coaxing and encouragement and we often needed to add a large amount. Also, she‚Äôd often leave a layer of uneaten kibble on the bottom. When she was young, my parents spoiled her with tasty table scraps, so I assumed she was just really picky. 

We purchased an airtight container for her kibble (Simplehuman stainless steel pet food can) and put the bag in it, but it didn‚Äôt help much. We buy 35 lb bags of Royal Canin Large Dog Food, which last about 2 months.

I noticed that whenever we opened a new bag, she ate happily for about a week or two, then began turning her nose up at the food. I started suspecting that the food was ‚Äúgoing bad‚Äù or turning rancid after a week of being exposed to the air. The pet food container was airtight, but each time we opened it,  we were exposing the entire 2 month supply to fresh air. By the time we reached the bottom of the bag, the kibble was really stale/rancid because it had been exposed to air so many times.

I decided to try opening the original bag as little as possible to keep the kibble fresh. I began a system of keeping the original bag closed tightly, and taking out approximately 2 weeks worth of kibble at a time. I‚Äôd store the 2 weeks of kibble in two 1-gallon airtight containers. Throughout each week, I‚Äôd feed my dog from the gallon containers until they ran out. Then I‚Äôd open the original bag, refill my gallon containers, and close it tightly again. I‚Äôd repeat this process for the entire 2 months until it was time to buy another bag of dog food.

Here are the specifics. Each gallon container held about 16 cups of food; my dog eats 3 cups a day, so each container held a little more than 5 days worth of food. I had two containers, so that‚Äôs 2 x 5 = 10 days of food. The 35-lb bag lasts about 2 months or 60 days. So over the course of 2 months, I open the bag only 6 times to refill my containers. This means the bottom kibble have been exposed to fresh air only 6 times, whereas in my previous system, by the time we reached the bottom, the kibbles had been exposed to 60 cycles of fresh air, and therefore were much more oxidized/rancid. 

My dog now happily eats her kibble down to the last pieces at the bottom of the bag. She‚Äôll eat the kibble straight up, totally dry. We don‚Äôt need to add anything to her meals anymore (though we still give her a little bit of wet food on top and some water because we want to treat her). She also eats twice a day now! I think after 6 months of age, she no longer had the ravenous puppy appetite that kept her eating the rancid kibble. And I think she refused breakfast and only ate dinner once per day because the kibble was so unappetizing that she wouldn‚Äôt eat until she was STARVING. She used to occasionally go 48 hours without eating before, but now she never skips a meal. It‚Äôs been a huge relief.

I hope this helps someone. I always thought that the airtight container was keeping things fresh enough, but I realize now that it wasn‚Äôt, and I was feeding my dog rancid kibble most of the time. No wonder she wouldn‚Äôt eat it - dogs have great noses after all.  It‚Äôs been so worth it to incorporate this system of taking kibble out every ~2 weeks and opening the original bag as few times as possible. And if I want to decrease the # of times I open the original bag, I can just add another gallon container to my rotation so I‚Äôd only have to refill every 15 days (thus opening the bag only 4 times).  

I‚Äôm sure you could also use larger airtight containers than I do (like 2 or 3 gallon jars) and still maintain adequate freshness. I just use gallon jars since they‚Äôre the biggest I could find from the food container brand I like. Just keep in mind that the larger the container, the more air cycles the bottom kibbles are exposed to.",Have a picky dog?

829,dogs,"My dog and I moved in with my sister about six months ago. She also has dogs. Overall, all is good between everyone. However, ever since we've moved in, my dog will drink excessive amounts of water. It's causing issues of him peeing in the house when he has always been housebroken. 

They all always have access to fresh water so it's not like he needs to be worried about sharing. The dogs are fed in separate rooms and each eats their meal in full so food is never an issue, but the water is left out all the time. 

He did not do this before we moved in and we have taken several trips together, have spent several weekends at my mom's (who does not have a dog), etc. and he does NOT do this in those situations. Which leads me to believe it could be a weird form of resource guarding? Like if he doesn't drink as much as he can, one of the other dogs will, even though...like I said, they all always have access to fresh water. He is never mean or aggressive about it if another dog comes near the water bowl. He will just drink and drink and drink until we cut him off or it goes empty.

He has an appointment at the vet to rule out any health issues that could be causing it but I am wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this?",Resource Guarding of Water?,1673559042,1242,27,243,4

She‚Äôs never been mounted by another dog before or has seen any other dogs getting humped before, so it is not a learned behavior and we don‚Äôt go to dog parks. She was also spayed mid December, so there‚Äôs no ‚Äúsexual maturity‚Äù for her to reach‚Ä¶ right?

So far my older dog doesn‚Äôt seem to mind since it has only been happening when they actively play/roughhouse, but my older dog does have a history of being mounted and attacked by 2 different dogs at different times when she was young, so I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt allow my puppy to do this to her.

I did order the doggie lawn and tried that with her but it doesn‚Äôt work.

837,dogs,"Hello! I have a 7 year old, male, Dogo Argentino Mix, his name is Booba but he doesn‚Äôt know that because he‚Äôs deaf and has been that way since I got him as a pup. Recently he‚Äôs taken a liking to my bedroom carpet - which is the only room in the house with a carpet texture along the lines of shag/frieze (idk much about carpet so just know that it‚Äôs longer). As a pup he gnawed on a few floor mats &amp; rugs but for years he‚Äôs been very good to furniture &amp; household items. 
Last week, I caught him repeatedly licking &amp; chewing on my bedroom carpet - it was same general area each time. I assumed that some sort of drink had been spilled there or some crumbs from possibly my snacks or his snacks (treats).
A few days after, I started the process of rearranging &amp; reorganizing - and now he‚Äôs ‚Äúeating‚Äù carpet anywhere and everywhere. I‚Äôm not sure if it started out as some sort of food/drink in the first area and then him (being the weird dog that he is) deciding he enjoyed the flavor and texture of the carpet?
I vacuumed and used my carpet cleaner on the entire floor after moving everything out of the bedroom for rearranging. I‚Äôm not sure what else could possibly be in my carpet, I think he just really likes carpet now.
He hasn‚Äôt touched any other carpet in the house so far - I do correct the behavior when I see it. I typically lightly stomp to get his attention (he doesn‚Äôt associate this with being in trouble as that is my usual way of getting his attention - if you tap him sometimes he gets startled &amp; I‚Äôve been nipped so I try not to) and I motion ‚Äòno no‚Äô which is just moving my pointer finger side to side (he knows what this means) and he‚Äôll stop but continues later when I‚Äôm not in the room or busy. 
Besides closing my bedroom door (he considers my room as his and it really kind of is so I feel bad locking him out but will if I have to) what else should I try?

I‚Äôve gotten him settled and comfortable and he‚Äôs doing great.
The only issue is that I can‚Äôt keep him, due to the comfort of my first baby and his comfort in a tiny apartment.(my baby is his sister, btw from the same litter).

I was a bit on the fence, about rehoming him but now I‚Äôve decided I want to.
He‚Äôs well behaved. He‚Äôs in a good health, and he gets along well with my girl, but she still acts distant with me and my partner. And I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving my attention to another dog anymore. If she sees us pet him, she‚Äôll leave the room and lay on her bed and not respond to us. She‚Äôll go in his kennel when we give him treats. She used to have a usual routine of snuggling with us on the couch, as we sat down after work. She won‚Äôt do it anymore. Despite this new boy not even liking snuggles with us or getting on the couch. (He doesn‚Äôt care care for snuggles and isn‚Äôt needy for pets like she is.) she also is picky about eating now. She Wont eat if he‚Äôs eating.  There‚Äôs just a whole string of things that have changed since he got here. On top of that, I adopted this boy and he left an environment of free roam in an old saburban town where he never wore a collar or walked on a leash. He was well trained, though. As an outside dog. Never left his home except to run in fields with his previous owner and hang out at construction sites. He‚Äôs extremely loyal.

I originally took him in with the intention to get him house broken and rehome him, because his owner was going to take him to a kill shelter. (Which he didn‚Äôt know was a kill shelter.) and after searching and searching, he couldn‚Äôt find anyone that would take him, I opted to because he was such a sweet boy. Anyways, I‚Äôve fallen in love with him, but I think he just might do better in a home with a yard and a family that has other dogs that are playful/ or playful kids.

So here‚Äôs my question:
He‚Äôs a few more weeks out, maybe more, from being comfortably house broken. He‚Äôs amazing on a leash. Goes in his kennel. Great eater. And mostly responsive to his name on recall.

I have a jindo-mix, estimated to be 3 years old and medium sized (like 22kg). On Saturday, he did a nice hour walk in the forest, got a bath (which he hates), and I gave him a large bone thing as a treat. He normally only gets beef knuckles or no-hide chews but the big bone was a christmas gift from someone, so I just gave him that. 

That evening, after he's had his breakfast and dinner of softened kibble, pumpkin, and some freeze-dried beef (he always eats this, divided into two meals, one in the late morning, one around 5-6pm), he vomits everything out. It has been a few hours since his dinner, so I'm shocked. But his entire dinner is there, nothing has been digested. 

That night, he has a very large amount of soft poop, very light colored. Then before bed, he pukes again and I can see large pieces of that bone from the morning. I'm concerned but he's puked and felt better the next day before, so I'm willing to sleep on it. 

All of Sunday, he's having the runs. No vomit though. Around the afternoon, this diarrhea is starting to get redder. By the end of the night, it's like reddish-brown and very watery. I give him white rice and chicken breast, but he's only having a handful of it if I hand-feed him. 

Monday, I'm freaked out because the blood is now jelly like. Then in the afternoon, he tries to vomit but it's just bile. He does this again around 2 AM, which is also when he is going out every hour to try to poop, but only drops of blood is coming out at this point. He had some pumpkin, rice and chicken. Most he's eaten since Saturday night. My vet is closed on Monday, so I decide to make an appointment tomorrow if he's not better. 

Tuesday, he is basically just pooping bright red blood water. Not a lot, just drops. I call and make an appointment with the vet. We go in around 2PM, they decide to put him on an IV until 6:30PM due to some dehydration, do xrays, bloodwork, check for parasites, etc. Note, all this time, he's not too lethargic, he does his morning walks totally fine apart from the bloody poops, and he's drinking water pretty well. 

When I go back to pick him up, they say there's nothing particularly wrong. He's a very anxious boy, so he had a rough time at first but they got him on an IV and he was just resting. His Xrays showed amounts of gas but they said it was not concerning at this point. There was no infection or worms or parasites, no obstructions (this was what I was most afraid of), nothing is 'wrong'. 

So he gets probiotics, cans of Royal Canin Gastorintestinal Wet food (to be fed 1/4 of the can at a time, 4x a day), some anti-inflammatory meds, and deworming meds for good measure. All meds to start the next evening if he doesnt throw up. 

We go home, he's very energetic and happy and he eats his first quarter of the wet food very well. 

That night, he has a less bloody episode of diarrhea and though he gets up every hour to try to get out, I am able to coax him to sleep until the morning. 

Now, it's Wednesday (yesterday), he does his 40 min walk in the morning, watery and reddish brown diarrhea, otherwise happy and hydrated boy. I can get him to eat the wet food for 3 of the 4 times he's supposed to eat it. He still hasn't had any of the meds yet because I am waiting till 8pm to see if he will vomit or not. 6PM, he projectile vomits. It's very watery, I can tell there are bits of the wet food, and he does this 2 more times. That night, he's very restless and has to be taken out every hour where he does very little drops of jelly-like blood, and it isn't until near 2AM where he finally lays down. I don't know if he actually slept through the night or if he just laid there. 

Now, Thursday morning, he's just resting by the door. We went out, but no poop or pee, and he didn't want to walk. I attribute this to the rain but normally, he is okay to just do a quick pee and run back in at least. I figure he's expelled so much liquid, it's ok that I just let him rest until this afternoon to pee. 

I call the vet, they just say I can go in for a progress checkup. But to be honest, I am not feeling this vet anymore. I feel like feeding the chicken and rice was doing better than the wet food that was prescribed. My only concern is that maybe there IS something wrong, but I want to believe the vet when he said nothing seems wrong. 

Any similar experiences or advice? I'm going to let him rest until dinnertime and then try to see if he wants some chicken and rice, then give him the meds he hasn't taken yet (hopefully he won't throw up today).

But I feel like the one driving factor that made me adopt her and that gives me moments of feeling good about it, is when I think of her needs and happiness. 

But when it comes to the best personality fit for me and my other girl I've had for two years, it feels like I didn't prioritize those aspects. 

I'm confident this young girl would get adopted quickly if I choose to take her back. But that still feels awful.

867,dogs,"I adopted my dog from a rescue last year and have had her for a little over a year at this point. She is a very anxious pup (not sure what her background looked like) and does not enjoy any changes to her routine. 

We are going on a 1 week vacation in 2 months and have made plans for her to stay with my parents. Since adopting her, we have visited my parents almost on a weekly basis and she is very familiar with their house, gets along well with their dogs (she loves playing with them and running around outside in their yard), and likes to cuddle on the couch with my mom. 

I know that she will be well cared for while we are gone, but I can‚Äôt help feeling guilty that she will think we have ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù her.

868,dogs,"Hello! I'm interested in starting an early search for a dog fit (looking at a couple years down the road). I think a dog could really help my anxiety, so I'm looking for an anxiety ESA dog that I could train for DPT. One thing to note is I have OCD (mostly regarding germs) so I prefer a clean dog, and I am currently trying to manage that as much as possible (I am probably not in the best place to handle a dog at this very moment). I am also going through some career/location changes, so I won't be able to tell you where I'm living. These are the main reasons I'm waiting a couple years to get a dog.  


 \*\*Introduction\*\*    


1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?   
Yes  


2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?   


Reputable breeder

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sweet, affectionate, and attentive. I want to really feel that the dog loves me (and of course I will love them too!) and cares about me, particularly if they can respond to my emotions (most notably, anxiety). I believe I have the capacity to give the dog lots of frequent attention, though there may be some brief times when I need a little bit of distance, so I'd like my dog to be trainable enough to respond to that. I'm not the most active, so I would want a dog that doesn't require a lot of physical activity, but can also  help motivate me to go out regularly (i.e., on walks).

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that poodle mixes are good in terms of cleanliness and trainability. I personally really like floofy dogs (pomeranians, huskies, etc.) though I worry they might also be the ones that shed the most and smell the worst! I've heard king cavaliers have a good temperament. But in general, I'm pretty open minded.

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

&amp;#x200B;

All basic commands. Respond to my anxiety. DPT. Have enough self restraint to give me space when I need it (though in general I expect to be able to give lots of affection most of the time). I also think remaining calm around others is useful in case I need to take the dog out with me (i.e., for anxiety purposes). Bonus points for being good on planes!

&amp;#x200B;

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  

&amp;#x200B;

Nope

&amp;#x200B;

 \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

&amp;#x200B;

Not quite sure since I don't know what job I will have. General care: of course daily with full commitment. Low-key activity (e.g., cuddles): multiple hours daily. Active play: maybe an hour or so daily? Training: a little bit of time daily with more time on the weekends, and I am also interested in paying for professional training.

&amp;#x200B;

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe 30 min - 1 hr on regular days, plus more on weekends. I would mostly just go on walks and take them to a dog park.

&amp;#x200B;

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to brush daily. I would probably prefer a professional to do trimming/cleaning/other grooming.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

10)	What size dog are you looking for? 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure. I am a 90 lb, &lt;5 foot tall person who is week and has chronic shoulder pain, so probably not super big unless well trained. I am also not the most active and am unsure I could satisfy a large dog who needs more physical activity. Other considerations:  


* DPT: I'm not entirely sure the right size dog for deep pressure therapy. Any thoughts? If it helps, I use a 10 lb weighted blanket and find it's too light for me unless I fold it in half hot dog way. Makes me think 20 lbs might be sufficient.
* Portability: With my anxiety, being able to take my dog to many places is a big plus.
* Planes: How feasible is it to take dogs on planes? I know ESA dogs don't get special rights, but Google says you can take a &lt; 20 lb dog on a plane under the seat in front of you. Is that ok for the dog?
* Travel: Even if the dog cannot come on a plane with me, just being able to take the dog on trips is a plus. I am in academia, so I travel semi-regularly to random places for conferences. This isn't a requirement though.

&amp;#x200B;

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? 

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely prefer cleanliness. Most importantly, I would like a dog that doesn't have a super strong odor (though I understand all dogs smell somewhat). Minimal slobber is also a strong preference. Shedding is somewhat more acceptable, but I would also prefer minimal shedding. I'm personally ok with barking, but I need the dog to be trainable enough so we don't bother other people/dogs around us.

&amp;#x200B;

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhat preferable. Not necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

&amp;#x200B;

Predominantly snuggly but can at times respect personal space.

&amp;#x200B;

 14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?  

&amp;#x200B;

Eager to please.

&amp;#x200B;

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

&amp;#x200B;

Slight preference for being friendly and interested in guests, hopefully not too in-your-face or anything. This is less important than some other things I've mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

&amp;#x200B;

No. As a physically weak person I'm not sure how much I could handle this.

&amp;#x200B;

17) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?  

&amp;#x200B;

Anything that would be too difficult to deal with as a small/weak person.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

&amp;#x200B;

Possibly for a full work day (maybe up to 10 hours). I expect to spend hours of time with the dog each day (mostly multitasking).

&amp;#x200B;

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?  

&amp;#x200B;

Can't answer this yet, unfortunately. There will likely be other people in my house, though. All adults.

&amp;#x200B;

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

&amp;#x200B;

No. I like the idea of being able to get a cat too in the future, but I have no idea if that will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

&amp;#x200B;

No. Probably not at all.

&amp;#x200B;

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

&amp;#x200B;

Rent. Again, can't determine this. I'm pretty willing to prioritize dog over place.

&amp;#x200B;

 23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

&amp;#x200B;

USA, and no. Small chance I'll move to Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

&amp;#x200B;

Can't really say. The coldest places I will likely end  up in are Boston or Vancouver. The hottest places are in southern California.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't drive, so being able to take public transit or use rideshare with the dog is important. I'm not sure exactly what this implies.

&amp;#x200B;

870,dogs,"I had my girl (female golden) at the local park the other day , all the way at the back , and this guy was walking by on the road (a good acre or more away from us) and his dog decided to come over and sat hello. He started to call her back immediately and she kept going. She didn‚Äôt run , didn‚Äôt charge, just casually walking. We ignored her.  It took her a good 2 - 3 minutes to even get close enough my dog stopped sniffing to notice. The guy made no effort to run over and grab her , no urgency , nothing. Just casually strolling over and calling her repeatedly (which she didn‚Äôt even acknowledge) and when she got closer I stopped my dog and put myself in front of her. The guy goes ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry she‚Äôs friendly‚Äù and I said (not very kindly I‚Äôll admit) ‚Äúshe should still be on a leash‚Äù and then took my dog in the opposite direction. 
There was no sorry , nothing. No response from him at all and he had to get almost right up to his dog to get her to follow him again. Still no leash , and they wandered off to one of the walking trails. I was so irritated. 

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong , I have no problem with off-leash dogs on trails or in parks *if they have amazing recall*. My old co worker has trained all of her dogs to be off leash and as soon as we spot people or other dogs she calls them and they come right back and they go on a leash until we know we‚Äôre alone again. 

But it‚Äôs all the ones who have shit recall that are off leash and the owner insists ‚Äúthey‚Äôre friendly‚Äù and it drives me nuts.

Mods, feel free to remove this if there are resources in the FAQ - I looked and nothing seemed to come up.

I assume they're playing, but due to their size difference, I'm worried someone's going to get hurt. There's no whining. They seem to know each other's limits. A couple people who have had dogs have said this is just them playing. But my anxiety is a wreck.

The other issue is, they always want to steal each other's treats... How do I train this out of them? Because this leads to more sparring.

We work, own our home, and have a fully fenced back yard.  The main thing keeping us from adopting has been our work/school schedule; between 7am and 3pm nobody is home.  I would plan to crate train but that sound like a long time to be in a crate to me.  The doggie daycare down the street works out to about $27/day... while out of reach for daily use, I could see going like once a week for socialization.  The local dog walker wants $16/day for a 20 or so minute visit.

After doing some reading I hit upon the idea of building an indoor kennel.  We have a large unused 16' x 20' space in the basement, not useful for living because the ceiling is only 5'5"" but I can't imagine a dog would care much about that.  Concrete walls, safe from the elements, etc.  I think I could convert it into a decent play/hangout space.

What I don't know is whether it's a good idea.  I'd still like to crate train, of course, and his primary situation would naturally be with the family.  The only time I see him in the kennel is while we're working on the days he's not a daycare.

922,dogs,"Hazel, my fiancee's rescued GSD mix (about 6) attacked Bandit (my husky, 10) for seemingly no reason. 

Hazel has been living with my fiancee's ex (they have kids together) for most of the year. Hazel stayed with Bandit and I for about 3 months (Dec 21 - Feb 22) while she made the transition to moving into my house, so they have been acquaintances for a while. I even took them in my truck to get shots together since then with no problems. 

This year we got a white German Shepherd (Ghost, 9mo) and he can be quite full of energy and annoying. We thought maybe it would be a good idea to bring Hazel back over to meet and play with Ghost. None of these dogs have ever shown dog aggression out of the normal ""leave me alone"" scrap/nip here or there.

When Hazel arrived I had my fiance keep her on her leash outside and I brought Ghost outside to meet her, also on a leash. Ghost was very submissive and she seemed to like him so we thought all was good. Brought them both inside, and so I went to let Bandit out. Everyone sniffed and everything was good. Walked into the living room and everyone was getting pets and having a good time for all of 3 seconds, and without warning, Hazel jumped on Bandit and latched onto his neck and started trying to shred him to pieces. Turns out, she had his leather collar in her teeth and never actually bit him at all, but I thought he was going to die. I tried pushing her off, punching her in the face, yelling, and choking her, but to no avail. It looked like one of those pitbull videos where they just do not let go. When I got my arm around her neck, Bandit, desperate to fight back, got my arm in his mouth and chomped down hard. I tried to pick Hazel up and with Bandit now locked on my forearm, I had over 120lbs of dog in my arms. I then tried to poke Hazel in the eyes to get her to release, and Bandit managed to gash open my hand in 2 places (6 stitches!) while trying to get a hold of her. At this point, Hazel had spun his collar around and was on the underside of Bandits collar, which allowed my fiance to grab the back of his collar from relative safety and I pulled Hazel's legs til they were finally separated. 

Things of note: 
Ghost just ran around like an idiot while this was happening.
Hazel was dropped off by the ex without a regular collar. Her leash was on a prong collar, which I removed once she was inside like I always have. I wish I hadn't. 
My living room is kinda small. There was a lot of dog in a relatively small space. My theory is that Hazel may have just gotten overwhelmed.
I did not notice any signs of distress before this happened. No tails going from up to down, no big eyes, no flattened ears, snarls, teeth, or any signs that stuff was about to go down.

My living room security camera recorded everything. I have watched the video dozens of times and still can't figure out what happened. None of these dogs have ever had problems with aggression before. 

Bandit is now on home quarantine by animal control since he managed to bite me while trying to fight Hazel off. They were contacted by the urgent care I went to for stitches. They didn't care about the aggressor. 

I can't really think of anything else. My question is why? We were worried about Hazel and Ghost getting along since Ghost was new. We still can't figure out why she attacked Bandit, which she knows and has lived with.

926,dogs,"Tl;dr aggression, constant bathroom accidents are making me exhausted. 

I‚Äôve been taking care of a dog for a long time. I have reached the point of physical and mental exhaustion. 

The dog used to be fine but several years ago their puppy anxiety restarted out of nowhere. It was easier to just sleep with them in the same room than it was to properly work out the behavior because the dog would literally stay up the whole night howling if I didn‚Äôt come. This was 5 years ago and I‚Äôve been sleeping on a cot in a basement ever since. 

When covid happened I had to leave for a short while. I left them with someone they had known and in the same house so it‚Äôs not that they were removed from their known home. I came back and the dog would snarl and growl with food. Where they never had food aggression before. They would bite hard when I tried to brush their teeth or trim nails. I tried to work on the teeth brushing by starting slow but it didn‚Äôt help. I took them to the vet to get it done and the vet had to do some extractions. The teeth are back to square one and will probably need to be extracted again. **I admit that I let the teeth brushing fall behind because I got tired of being bitten and used it as an excuse to not deal with it.**

I have given up every part of my life to take care of this dog but I‚Äôm just feeling overwhelmed and resentful. I gave up working outside and am home most of the time. I can‚Äôt even go out to check mail because when I come back they will go to the bathroom in the crate. Most days I have to wait until the evening for them to go to the bathroom before I can go change out of my pjs from the night before. 

Recently it‚Äôs been one new medical problem after another. They have started to lose weight despite feeding more to keep up with weight gain. When I go to the vet they make me feel like garbage because of how bad the situation is but I‚Äôm honestly exhausted from doing everything and barely even being alive myself. I get anxiety when I think about having to leave the basement because I know I‚Äôll come back to a mess. I time out their feeds, take them to the bathroom after, and again right before I leave, I still come back to accidents. I would even just put up with the aggression if I could figure out what the issue with the bathroom is or how to deal with it.",Need advice,1673510189,2323,11,456,2

934,dogs,"ok so i have a 6 year old boxer and at around the age of 2 she started to become very picky with her food we would find a solution in doctoring her food like putting stuff in it like cheese or eggs and it would work for a few weeks and then she would decide that she didn't like it anymore so we would try something else and it would work for a few weeks and once again she decided she didn't like it anymore and this cycle has been going on for a few years.

so fast forward a couple years around the age of 4 we are still adding stuff in and the cycle is still going on she has started eating a bit more it would take her all day to eat around 3 cups of food and she had started to gain weight and had started to get a few tiny bald spots and became extremely lazy to the point of sleeping around 18-20 hours a day she had lost almost all interest in playing or taking walks whenever we would try to take her on one she would resist as much as she could to the point of her collar coming off so we would still try every once and a while but we didn't want to force her so we just let her go back inside like she wanted to and go back to sleep (around this time our older dog had recently died so we just assumed she was depressed and missed her) soon enough after we stopped doctoring it for awhile she didn't complain much anymore but it still took her all day to eat it

at age 5 she was much fatter and still ate the same amount of food she did before we started noticing that her hair loss was getting worse she had more small bald spots and we remembered that had happened to our other dog when she was her age she had got a bit of her hair back after we changed her food so we tried that and it did nothing to help her we also noticed not only was she losing hair but her skin was black underneath (and idk if the black skin is anything to be alarmed about idk if thats normal or not it just seemed odd so i thought i would leave that detail in) and it sometimes would peel in places

now at age 6 ( she will be 7 in june) she has bald spots all over her back her ankle area on her hind leg is so dry that it like a dusty gray and her nose is cracking and breaking and is always dry she still didn't eat a lot up until around christmas time when we got a new puppy and she will only eat if the puppy comes near her food she sleeps all day and night and is only up for about 2-3 hours a day she only wants to play when we try to play with the puppy and she is obese (but not morbidly thankfully) last time we took her to the vet they said she was around 50 lbs

I don't know if anyone has experience with this, but my 11 year old dog is drinking more water ever since I put him on kidney diet?

However, I notice he is drinking more water after a full transition to this diet and he seems to be peeing more. I don't know if this is normal? I thought the kidney diet was suppose to help with the frequency of urination since the kidney diet contains less proteins (less toxins for the kidney to filter out)

939,dogs,"Hello all!

A little background on my dog; he's a 12 year old yorkie mix (we don't know with what else), 6 months ago he was in the later stages of kidney failure and was effectively on the edge of death. We started him on Fluid treatment and a phosphate blocker and his recovery was nothing short of miraculous, within weeks he had gone back to the puppy he once was. We continued his treatment and he was stable until recently. 

Three weeks ago we moved into a new house, at first he seemed really excited to have a new place to explore and looked was running around sniffing everything all day with his tail going wild. But about a week ago he had a very dramatic change in personality. He started shaking all the time, would stumble when he walked and twitched a lot (like hard jerks), he seemed extremely lost and confused. He has also slept with my parents his whole life but suddenly he would only sleep with me and whine when in their bed. 

We honestly thought he was just at the end of his rope and had resigned ourselves to putting him down if our vet agreed, but surprisingly our vet said he didn't think it was time yet. He said our dog seemed mentally aware and not in any extreme pain but gave us some general pain relief anyway just to see and sent us home.

After getting home not much changed, but today we realized he may have gone blind. Our reasons for thinking this are; our dog no longer makes eye contact and can only follow you with his eyes in a well lit room if you're moving, he's bumped into a few walls recently and fallen off a bed twice, he wont walk anywhere which we thought was due to the stumbling but the stumbling doesn't actually seem to bother him any (like he still whines to be let outside instead of peeing himself, so I don't think walking physically hurts), it explains why he always looks so lost and confused, and he'll still eat food but you have to put it right up to his mouth for him to find it, we also tried a few ""tests"" like slowly walking towards a wall with him in our arms and he wouldn't move his face away from the wall until his nose touched it, and also if you move food away from him, he'll try to grab where the food was, not where it is. 

The problem is he seems very depressed as a result of this. He doesn't do much other than sleep, eat and potty. He doesn't get excited when my parents get home anymore. He just seems very lethargic in general. He has improved a bit over the past few days, he's shaking less, he's eating more if the food is put in front of him and he's taking some baby steps around the house. 

Do you guys think he's blind given the examples i've listed? And if so what can we do to try and get him functioning again? I've read dogs can live normal lives after going blind but I have no idea what to do to get him started on the road to recovery.

Spitz breeds do just fine when they are in shape and properly groomed

""Asian meat dogs"" that you find at shelters are mostly from \*domestic\* puppy mills, and rescues buy these dogs to capitalize on American xenophobia

Extending on that last part a little bit, We probably wouldn't have a homeless pet problem if rescues were ok with putting themselves out of business. 

Rescue dogs do not ""love more deeply because they've seen the shit end of the stick"" they're traumatized. 

Breed-specific restrictions target poor people and people of color, not dogfighting rings.

Viewing animals' care through the eyes of a human being versus what is actually good/bad for them has set us back years in husbandry standards. 

People who rag on show/working dog handlers having their dogs' ears and tails done and then turn around and alter 12-week-old puppies have no room to talk.

Racing hounds are not malnourished, you're just used to dogs that are overweight. 

Introducing natural bobtails that are probably going to have to be docked shorter anyway to be in standard or not a hazard solves nothing.

 They know ""enough"" means to stop barking/fighting but when I say it they will stop, look at me, look at what they were barking at, growl a bit, and continue barking. I've tried yelling, giving them a little slap on the nose, telling them to go lay down, etc. 

They are walked about every three hours by either me or my aunt, they go to the dog park every other week and interact with other dogs, they get all the exercise they need, fed with kibble and most days added liver/chicken, have a bin of toys they can pick out of at anytime, and are spoiled beyond belief.

I‚Äôve seen it twice but according to my daughter she saw it start and happen last night so that I‚Äôm aware my heeler has done this 3 times in 24 hours.

I did a quick check and saw no noticeable scratches or bruising so I‚Äôm thinking it has to be internal. I will say he had recently eaten his food so I‚Äôm wondering if it a bad stomach ache? He is an inside dog and hasn‚Äôt gotten into any chemicals that I am aware of but recently he tore his old bed up and it full of Cotten fluff it‚Äôs possible he ate some but I didn‚Äôt witness it. His appetite seems to be doing fine and so is his water consumption. He does seem to be a little low energy but doesn‚Äôt seem to be in distress except for the quick minute he had his yelping and shaking and after that minute he seems to be fine, took him outside and he saw another dog and his energy shot up. Daughter said he had diarrhea in the morning but when I took him out it was solid. I‚Äôm just concerned about the yelping and since he was shaking I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs out of pain, he came straight to me while it happened as if asking for help. Am I over reacting? Could it be a bad stomach ache or stomach bug? Could it be a hidden tick? He is a heeler so he is a short haired dog but still possible to have a tick somewhere?

955,dogs,"My dog is on Simparica Trio once per month. I end up finding a flea on him once every few weeks- the flea appears to be dying, as I see it in his fur, it is moving slowly and seizing sort of, so I'm able to grab it out and smush it (i.e. it doesn't jump like a live/healthy flea). The first few times this happened I combed and bathed him after and never found any other ones. I've never found any other ones. 

We live in suburbia but in the PNW with woods surrounding the neighborhood. He goes to the groomers about once a month and we end up being at the vets every other month ish. However many times the fleas don't necessarily correspond with us just having visited one of these places or having just taken a walk.

About 9 months ago we struggled with a very minor flea infestation in our home when we found several on him (only saw like 3 total in the house), but we had a professional pest company spray our whole house and treat our yard, and we vaccuumed daily for 2 weeks. It seemed to go away. I never used to check him for fleas before this incident, but after that incident, I now do once every few days. I don't know what's normal because I never paid attention to whether he had fleas before the infestation.

I have a 4 month old female English Bulldog, purchased from a breeder who as part of the contract I signed stated that I must wait until after the first heat cycle to spay her (but before the second). They were adamant about this. Bulldogs are prone to joint issues and if we spay too early it may have a negative impact on her joint development. 

However our vet is really pushing for her to be spayed before her first cycle. And I mean PUSHING. The main reason being it basically eliminates her risk of developing mammary cancer (7-8% if spayed after first cycle, 0.5% if spayed before), among other reasons. Not sure what to do, should I listen to the breeder, or my vet? There are pros and cons to both sides, I've never owned a female dog before and am really conflicted. 

I should mention that I've done a lot of research on what to expect during a heat cycle and am fully willing to help her through the difficulties of one if it comes to that.

963,dogs,"Now from reading on this site there seems to be hatred and fear of bringing your dog to the dog park and I can understand that.  I've seen some of the dog parks where people would rather socialize or watch their phone rather than watch their  own dog and problems always do seem to happen so I've avoided those parks with my 3yo Cane Corso. 

About 10 months ago I found a dog park close to my house on an abandoned air base that's near my house.  The gates were falling off,  the grass was to long, the tables were falling apart, so I grabbed my tools and weed Wacker and proceeded to fix these problems.

As i was fixing things up some other people who walked the runways came around and we started talking and they started helping and then more people came around and after a couple of weeks we had a functioning dog park.

It was nothing to be proud of due to the lack of use and lack of landscaping but it became ours after a while and we all enjoyed meeting up at around 4 o'clock  in the summer and 3 o'clock in the winter and we all watched our own dogs and each other's. 

All of our dogs knew and enjoyed each other's dogs and their owners and look forward to meeting there every afternoon. 

In the beginning I thought, it's no big deal just dog park people ,but as more people started to come around and it got more dogs coming around something happened, A community was forming . Everyone looked out for each other and if a new dog was out of line then the owner was asked to control their dog or move over to the other side(both sides were equally large) if the person was being a jerk and refused to control their dog,  we all just moved to the other side and the person would get the not so suttle hint and leave and not come back.

Now something amazing happened this weekend which is why I'm posting this story. 
I went away on vacation,  the first time without my dog since I rescued him and I had a friend( not from the dog park) watch him. 
He has a dog too and we've been on many walks in the woods with him and his dog and I've watched his dog when he went on vacation.  My dog knew his son and wife and he's always been cool at their house. 

Well the first day I left when I got to the resort a had a Facebook message that his boy went to hug my dog from behind and scared my dog who turned around and bit him in the face. 12 stitches. 

Now i have limited communication where i was but managed to get a hold of some of the dog park people who went and retrieved him and held onto him, sheltered him, fed him and exercised him for the next 4 days until I could get a flight back home. 

There were 6 people in all who traded off shifts to make sure my dog was comfortable and well looked after.

If it wasn't for the dog park I'd have never met these fine folks and don't know what I would have done to get my dog away from my friends house .

By the way every time that my dog was shuffled to someone else's house he was cool with it because he already knew the people and the dogs. 

So as many stories as I read here about how shitty dog parks are,  this is my story about how good we made a dog park and how we built a community around it.

I (29F) work from home M-Th, and bf is off on Fridays. So the puppy never has a day alone. Currently I have a team belated holiday lunch on the 26th, a Thursday. The restaurant is a 30min drive away one way and the lunch is roughly 1.5 hrs long. So this is at max 3 hrs the puppy would be crated and alone. The bf could maybe swing by on his lunch, but not guaranteed due to his line of work. 

We got him at 8 weeks old and ever since then when he is left alone for only a few minutes he will empty his bowels completely in his crate. I've been working on increasing the time and tried 5min tonight. I was working out in the room down from his. I checked in on him at 5 minutes and....pee and poop everywhere. Had been a couple hours since he ate. 

So my maximum is between 3-4 min alone. The entire time he is freaking out by the way. Howling, whining, banging on crate.

 Kong with frozen peanut butter?  He doesn't care. 
Treats? He doesn't care. 

As soon as I ever leave his sight he starts to whine. He only sometimes gets quiet around minute 2 and even then it's for 30 seconds max and then he picks back up and it gets even worse. Even if he is sleeping and I get up to go pee he wakes up and starts to cry. 

Everyone keeps telling me to deal with it and let yim be alone for the 3 hours and if that means sitting in pee and poop, so be it. The idea of that is mortifying to me. I can't imagine being so cruel. I am working on seeing if my team can switch it to Friday. I tried waiting to see if I could work him up before asking, but after tonight I gave up and asked. 

Even if that works out......I need help. I have no me time. Bf doesn't help out as much, but at the same time he should be able to be left alone.

Backstory: 

My husband(M23) and I (F22) adopted this pitbull terrier mixed puppy 4 months ago. She is now about 7 months old. I am mostly the reason we got her. We both wanted to get a dog and agreed on her, but it was me who proposed the idea because I was feeling very lonely at home alone when my husband went to work and thought a dog would be great company. I thought getting an older dog was a better idea, but my husband wanted a puppy so we could be the ones to raise her. The first few weeks of having her were good. Nothing out of the ordinary during the puppy stage happened. I was the primary person to train her, play with her, and just overall care for her since I am home 24/7 and husband works. He does help when he is home so this is not a matter of distributing the responsibility of the dog. But then I started having puppy blues on and off about 3 weeks into having her, and I am now starting to think that maybe I am not a dog person. 

This is the first indoor dog I‚Äôve had in my life. Growing up, my family had 3 dogs and they were always kept outside (my mom did not want them inside so I had no say in where the dogs were kept). I did not agree in keeping dogs outside the house all day and neither did my husband. I was also quite young when we got the family dogs, so I did not have the responsibility of cleaning after them and all that, so I don‚Äôt know how the puppy stage went with them. But regardless of that, I grew up tending to dogs outside. I did not know how they were inside bc they were not around us every second we were home. I didn‚Äôt know how smelly, dirty, and needy they are. My whole life I loved dogs and thought I was 100% a dog person. But after getting our puppy and experiencing how they are in a home, I am regretting getting her and I feel terrible. My husband grew up with dogs inside and knew their tendencies, and he loves our dog. 



Separate topic that I think is important:

We also got a kitten about a month ago that is now currently about 5 months old. The reason we got him was also because of me. My husband one day said that he thinks I am more of a cat person than a dog person, and that got me very interested in getting a cat. He likes cats, but he was hesitant in agreeing to get one because he was (reasonably) afraid I would end up hating it too since I always claimed to not like cats. Long story short, we got him and I absolutely love him. He has provided me the comfort I was hoping to gain when we got our puppy. He has also provided me with some peace amongst my frustrations with the dog. The kitten‚Äôs personality and tendencies mesh with mine a lot more than our puppy. Even though he still has lots of energy and is always bouncing off the walls (AND gives me allergies), he doesn‚Äôt bother me nearly as much as she does. We both still share the responsibility of the puppy, but I have taken the fully responsibility of caring for the kitten since I was the one that insisted on getting him. He is the family cat, but my husband claims that he is mine. Even though my husband was wary of it at first and left the kitten to me, he has come to love the little guy just as much as me. 



Current day:

Our puppy by all means is not even that bad. She is such a sweet girl and loves attention. She learned the basic commands pretty well and has never shown any kind of aggression towards anyone she knows. She is a little wary of strangers but she warms up to people very quick. Never barks except during play and only growls at strange outside noises (she‚Äôs a very good alarm system). She is also ok around the cat. She just wants to play with him but we constantly have to keep an eye on them together because she still scares him since she is bigger and is not gentle by any means. You would think she is an angel. And while she is great with all those things, she is still a dog, and dogs stink, lick their parts and want to then lick any exposed skin on your body, drag their poopy butts inside, ram their bodies into anything when they get zoomies, destroy $20 toys for you to have to clean up, are constantly in your face wanting attention, etc. Our dog is also a very picky eater (I hate any picky eaters, even humans), and she is awful with her feet. She is getting heavy and is always stepping on our feet and shoes and getting in the way of everything. I can‚Äôt comfortably cuddle with her because she never sits still. She has also been getting whiny in her play pen recently. We use it when we are busy doing something at home when we need her out of the way or can‚Äôt keep an eye on her since we still don‚Äôt trust to leave her alone in the house. She is crate trained and does not whine in there, and she was great in the pen until recently (maybe it‚Äôs because she also destroyed her bed in there and hasn‚Äôt gotten one put in with her since then).

I know many people will probably judge me for not having more patience with her for still being a puppy, but puppy or not, there are things about dogs that you just can‚Äôt change. She is a great dog for someone that does not mind the things I listed above, but for me, I can‚Äôt stand her. I have been having mixed feelings about her for a while now, and we even came close to rehoming her (to my parents since they adore her) because I had really bad depression for a while because of her. She showed signs of improvement and I had hopes for her to become a great adult dog, but those things about her have been angering me more and more lately that I‚Äôve just developed feelings of resentment towards her and my mood has been terrible too. My husband loves her and hates the attitude that I‚Äôve had towards her. He isn‚Äôt nearly as bothered by her as I am, so he would prefer to keep her, but we both put our relationship first before any animals. He is willing to agree to rehome her if it relieves the pressure I constantly feel and if it would improve my mood when we are home, but I would feel so guilty knowing he loved her and wanted her to stay when I am the reason we got her in the first place. 

All in all, I don‚Äôt know what to think or do. I still think I like dogs, but maybe I just don‚Äôt like being a dog mom. Maybe I am a dog aunt? Do I only like older, calmer dogs? Or am I strictly a cat person? I also want both me and the pup to have a good quality of life not just physically but also emotionally, because I know she senses my feelings towards her.. my husband and I both also agreed that she needs another dog buddy and a yard to run and release energy in. We are moving to a house with a big yard soon so the yard would not be an issue. It would also get her out of the house for some time and give me a little peace during the day as well. But about getting another dog.. I don‚Äôt know if I can do that. Maybe if it is older, calmer, and already trained?

We also have a hot tub and I told her that she‚Äôs free to use it as much as she wants as well (also mentioned how my dogs love when I go in the hot tub because it means I‚Äôm outside with them, which they enjoy and will get all excited/wrestle each other as a result).

976,dogs,"I was trying to find which proteins my dog likes best when I decided to pick up a can of Purina One for puppies because it was the only ground formula I could find in lamb. It turns out my dog really likes it. I don't know if it's the protein itself or maybe it's something in the puppy formula, but it distracts her from her reactive triggers more than other wet foods.

Looking online, I can't find an adult version with the same protein. I can only find a chicken/lamb Purina Pro and a grain-free chicken/lamb Purina Beyond, no just straight up lamb. It's also more convenient to me to buy it in person than order it online.

Is it okay to give adults puppy food as long as it's not their *main* food? I know it's more calorie dense then adult food but is there anything in the formula that could harm an adult?

I feel absolutely terrible about this decision, but I just can‚Äôt keep my pit bull. The thing is, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with her. She‚Äôs a total sweetheart to us, beautiful, calm, a great dog.

I always told myself I‚Äôd never get a pit bull because of the bite statistics, but we fostered her for a week long sleepover (you just get a random dog), she stole our hearts, and my boyfriend convinced me to keep her.

Recently though, I‚Äôve seen several headlines where children have been mauled to death by pit bulls. A mom and her two kids were killed by their two pit bulls last week. A few days ago a young boy was scalped by a pit bull. Presumably, these dogs hadn‚Äôt shown signs of aggression beforehand.

I feel terrible because I truly love my dog so much. But I‚Äôm planning to have a kid eventually, and I just don‚Äôt know what could make my dog snap or turn on us and I could never forgive myself if she hurt my child, or someone else. 

I guess I could just keep her until I have kids, but that seems sort of cruel. I don‚Äôt know. Does anyone have advice for me? I figure I‚Äôll get a lot of hate on this post, but maybe someone who can sympathize can pm me.

I never noticed how much my dog slept before but all she does now is go into different rooms, sleep, wake up, stretch, come look at me then go sleep somewhere else. She doesn't play with any toys. The only time she gets up is if she hears I am in the kitchen where she stares until the food is gone. She devours her food, she has a huge appetite 

I have a backyard too, she just smells a little bit around the fence and then comes back inside. I walk her everyday for an hour, it's more like a hike through woods, streams and she loves to chase birds, she caught a duck one time etc.

981,dogs,"Over the last month or so my dog (8YR Female, and one of three dogs in our house) has become so skittish and unsettled. Not *afraid* like tail between legs etc type behaviour, just jumping at every slight movement and noise. Some background: I am currently expecting my first baby, and am in my third trimester. I expected maybe some odd clingy-ness which I know is common or seems to be among expecting parents dogs. She hasn‚Äôt been more clingy than usual, and although she was a bit skittish before of things like plastic bags or sudden loud noises, this is a whole new level. Some examples: our other dog is laying on the dog bed and soundlessly rises up to get off. My dog isn‚Äôt even on the bed with her and she jumps up nervously. Or I get up off the couch, again jumps up nervously (not excitedly), and goes to follow me even though she had been sleeping.

982,dogs,"Yesterday afternoon my dog (German shepherd, 7 months) started getting diarrhea, I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. I went to the gym and when I came back she had an diarrhea accident in her crate. She was still acting and eating normally. Throughout the night 3-4 times with her having diarrhea. Towards the end she was straining.

In the morning (7am) she puked and was straining so I called the vet. She didn‚Äôt have an appetite either and was lethargic (she was still responsive). Before I left for the vet she got her appetite back but I took the bowl to ensure she didn‚Äôt eat until the vet‚Äôs directions.

We got to the vet and she was her normal happy self (she loves the vet). No temp or abdominal pain. They said it was colitis but didn‚Äôt really do anything diagnostic and said they‚Äôd treat her symptomatically.

We were sort of forced into a very temporary rescue situation of a 1 year old dog just smaller than our dog. Suddenly my dog became a lot more active, they were playing with each other, the new dog was a powerful scent trail on new walks and such for my blind dog, they were cuddling together, etc. Great! With advice of vet and internet telling us this was an ideal second life for the older dog, we adopted the younger one. 

Now it‚Äôs been about 6 weeks, and while they still get along, older dog is stressssssed tf out. Whining and panting so much. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to our younger dog or just still adjusting to blindness / old age, but he is basically never content. It was about the same before the other dog, though. All he wants is food. He hates being touched at all for the most part, even with a vocal warning we‚Äôre there (used to be incredibly cuddly). He wants up on the couch, then whines to get down. Eggs the younger dog on to play, but gets incredibly stressed the second the younger dog moves at a faster pace. 

Health reports are normal, echo recently showed that he has some stress on his lungs and it‚Äôs undetermined if it‚Äôs mild bronchitis or allergies. Our vet keeps riding it off as allergies. 

Anyways. We‚Äôve spoken to the vet, and they just prescribed trazadone.

On Friday I took my dog to an emergency vet because he was acting unlike himself- lethargic, uninterested in food/walks. The emergency vet ran blood work and found low RBC and platelet count. They sent off a Coombs test which came back positive. 

I took him on Monday for more blood work. His levels increased from 30 to 34 which is good. His energy levels seemed to be going up with the 100mg doxycycline and 10mg prednisone. 

Today (Wednesday) he is tired. He‚Äôs alert and will lift his head up when I walk around the apartment but other than that very sluggish. I just tried to take him outside to go potty and he wouldn‚Äôt walk so I carried him downstairs and he peed right where I dropped him (as a boy dog this is unusual as he usually likes to sniff and pee all over).

995,dogs,"I've been fostering dogs for over 10 years now, and it's a huge part of my life. I can only take one dog a time, but I've been able to save hundreds of dogs now, and it brings me so much joy. I started fostering after I adopted my dog, Laika. She was just so well balanced, confident, joyful, behaved, and intuitive, and someone had to foster her for me to be able to be matched up with her, and it was the best way that I could think of to thank her. I'm a big fan of pack based learning and I knew that she had the right temperament to be able to really help dogs from all kinds of situations learn how to be a dog. She absolutely loved meeting all the different dogs, and she took it very seriously. She just was so intuitive and knew the difference between correcting a rude puppy and being non-reactive to a scared dog. If somebody stole her bone, she was secure and confident enough to know that we have bones for days here, and it's nothing to get upset about. I never had to worry about any behavior issues from her, and I could rely on her to never be causing problems. She got along with everyone. (Obviously I didn't just bring in a dog and let her deal with them, I just want to explain how her temperament contributed to being a huge help. I thought of her as a partner.) We would go to dog rescue events, and she was always at my side, and I called her the dog ambassador. She would lay down and be very still for kids who were nervous about petting her, and she just acted like she had never had a bad day in her life. She was in perfect health, and very unexpectedly passed away on New Years Eve from hemangiosarcoma. We are devastated and she left a huge void in our lives.

Initially, I thought that I would just continue fostering and just casually keep my eye out for the ""right"" dog. I have another dog, Izzy, who is the one foster dog that I adopted. She was very shut down when she came here, and she just bonded with me. I tried adopting her once, she went right back to being reactive, and she got returned, and I knew that I could give her the structure and stability and safety that she needed. She's a curmudgeon and doesn't *dislike* the foster dogs, but she just doesn't interact with them. All she wants in the whole world is to lay on her spot on the couch and be near me. I never thought that her and Laika were particularly close, I thought they interacted more like roommates who would sleep near each other and keep each other company, but after Laika passed, I realized just how much Izzy relied on her. Izzy has been very depressed, is barely eating, and hardly moves. 

I requested some puppies to foster, because I really, really needed to get snuggles and kisses from some happy, floppy bundles of joy. They healed so much of my heart, and Izzy's responding just a little bit more. But she really needs the stability of a permanent companion. I'm very worried about her. She's not particularly interested in the puppies, other than a passing curiosity, but she's never really interacted with the dogs anyway. 

I have been really considering one of the puppies, but I'm also trying to be very careful to not fall for the first puppy that I meet. But I really think that there's something special there. I requested to have her for one more week after her sister leaves on Sunday, because I want to see what she's like on her own with us. I've also been looking at young adult dogs online. I'm not sure if it would be better to get an adult where you know what their temperament is going to be like, or maybe having a puppy and getting them lots of early exposure to all kinds of things, lots of car rides and meeting different types of people, and getting that training in nice and solid can shape that temperament. If I got a puppy, I think I would stop fostering for a few months so I can get her trained and bonded with us and our pack and not confused by fosters coming in and out, but I'm worried about them not growing up into the kind of dog that I would be looking for if we adopted an adult. 

Right now, I see instincts that look like they would suggest that they would have the right personality. She was confident walking up to me, she's pretty calm, she's always checking in, she plays fairly and will often be the first one to flip over, she will bark and put her paw on her sister if her sister is getting into trouble, etc.

I know that I will never have another Laika. And I don't want to judge another dog against her. That's not fair to them, and I'm sure they will have all sorts of quirky, special behaviors that are unique just to them that I will love. And I'm sure that I'm at least somewhat responsible for Laika's behavior, and no matter what kind of dog we get, there will be lots of adjustment and training. But I still want to make sure that I'm getting a dog that has the core traits that let them be the next ""dog ambassador"" and that confident, well adjusted buddy that will be able to get along with any dog that they meet and be non-reactive. I know that alot of that will be training and exposure, but some dogs are certainly more suited to it than others.

996,dogs,"Hi everyone, so i‚Äôve been a lurker on this subreddit without joining up until now because I am plagued with a serious dilemma.

My fianc√© and I recently had to stay overnight with my in-laws at their house (hours away from our home) due to celebrating the holidays. For several reasons, we usually avoid the both of them the best we can with the exception of the holidays. Both of my in-laws make lots of money, are affluent and I am very sure can afford to invest in sitters, trainers, walkers or even a boarding facility; they just choose not to. 

My MIL and FIL own three dogs: a male in-tact bulldog, and two chihuahua mixes (a spayed female and a neutered male). It was brought to my fianc√© and I‚Äôs attention that all three dogs are being kept in one plastic kennel shut away in the laundry room with the lights off for likely up to over twenty hours a day. My MIL and FIL‚Äôs excuse is that the dogs, when left alone in their house while at work, pee and poop on the carpet/floors/walls. The dogs are released only for twenty to thirty minutes at most to use the restroom (no exercise, play times or training sessions) before they are returned back into the kennel for the remainder of the day/night. 

My fianc√© and I are very horrified by the treatment of the dogs and agree it is blatant abuse. I‚Äôve been considering calling local agencies to investigate that will hopefully find a better home for them, the issue is I‚Äôm not sure how this would turn over without further straining our relationship with them. We‚Äôve considered offering to rehome the dogs for my MIL and FIL, but we recognize that my MIL would outright reject my offer since she claims she is an ‚Äòanimal lover through and through‚Äô. This situation is also a great concern to me because my MIL discussed the idea for the bulldog to have a litter, which I just through and through one hundred percent do not agree with. 
I recognize that I need to prioritize what is clearly morally right, I‚Äôm just not sure how I should go about it. What should be my next steps?

Yes, I used to have a cat before her (passed away about a year and a half ago), so it's not that I'm new to dealing with kittens. I'm new to dealing with a traumatized animal. She pretty much hides under the bed non stop, comes out to eat and poop. Recently she started playing a bit with me (with those feather on a stick kind of toy), but she shies away every 5 seconds or so, so I have to coax her back to keep playing. For the most part when she tries to walk by me, I pretend to not see her because I noticed that she otherwise immediately hides away and won't come out for an hour afterwards. 

Her previous owners used to throw slippers at her, yell at her, hit her with a broom, their 7 year old would pull her by the tail and kick her (she was 6 months old when they took her in). After 2 months they ""returned"" her because she was ""broken and boring"" (aka they'd terrorized her to the point where she would hide in any hole that she would find and not eat). A friend of mine took her in to foster her, intending to adopt her, but sadly her own cat did not get along with the kitten. No one wanted to take her in, so I decided to do it, even though I'm not certain that I'm emotionally ready to take on a new cat after the death of my previous one. 

All of this to say: I'm asking for advice as to what I can do to make the transition and her settling in my home (and with me) as smooth as possible for her. Ideally I want non medicated ways to aid her, but if there's something that I should consider getting for her that you think might help her, please advice me about it. I've had her for two weeks if this makes any difference.","Help! New kitten, comes from an abusive home",1673991081,1716,44,347,8

1072,cats,"I currently have a Veken water fountain for my cat and he loves it, but it's a bit of a pain to clean. It doesn't have many parts, just the biggest problem I have is that it has so many crevices that buildup likes to stick to and I never feel like I can get it fully clean when I do it by hand, so I typically opt to throw it in the dishwasher. 

It's great that I have the option to put it in the dishwasher, and I admit that I may sound a little overdramatic complaining about it, but I hate that it almost feels like my only option for cleaning it cause if I have to clean it on a weekday, that means I have to rush to load the dishwasher (usually after having to unload it first) the second I get home from work to ensure that it's finished and ready to be set back up before I go to bed. Again, the dishwasher safe feature is great, I just wish that it was also easy to do a quick hand wash when needed.

With that being said, does anyone have any recommendations? If they're all like this, I'll just suck it up cause my cat loves his fountain and I would never take it away just because it's a pain to wash, but figured I'd at least try asking here to see if there's a better option out there that would make us both happy lol.

One of my cats passed a few months ago due to a collapsed lung / asthma. Was around 1 year old. I have another cat that is now experiencing similar problems - for context she is 9 years old but stays in the same room as my other cat who had the same issues. She‚Äôs at the vet being oxygenated and seems to be improving, but am worried that there may be another reason why both cats got the same problem? They‚Äôre both Scottish folds and due to their facial structure can be prone to respiratory issues, but it‚Äôs a bit odd that it‚Äôs just the two cats who live in the same room that are experiencing this. We have 3 other Scottish folds who stay/sleep in different rooms but haven‚Äôt gotten similar issues (thankfully). 

Obviously we are asking for guidance from our vet but does anyone have an idea of an external stimulus that may be causing this? Kitty litter? Or flea powder?

1148,cats,"Whenever I first got the cat, she was happy to be with her old owners(? she was a stray) and I. She was rubbing all on me, then started to hide after a few hours. Once they left I barely saw her. When I woke up she was in her crate she came here in. She did not leave her crate for a couple days with food (wet and dry) and water in clear sight. I managed to get her out of the crate and she just hides somewhere else. Again, barely ever coming out to use the litter box and pick at her food.

She lets me pet her, but does not take treats or wants me to try taking her out to get her to move around. She does not get aggressive at all, she just backs herself into a corner whenever i try and grab her but lets me pet and touch her without her moving or getting scared.

About the cat:
-She‚Äôs 2 and tiny. She was the runt of the litter by far.
-She has FIV and has a very small wound on her side (it is healing perfectly though) from what seems couple of months ago
-She walks a little funny sometimes however the family she‚Äôs coming from took her to the vet, got her all of her shots and she was in perfect shape bar the couple discrepancies above

He's also biting alot but I think that's from teething. He is climbing on the couch but not scratching at it (yet). He also scratches at the carpet sometimes. We don't have a problem with him getting into bed or on furniture, it's just when we're laying down trying to watch TV, on our phones at night, or going to sleep. We do play with him a lot, he has plenty of toys and a cat tree with scratching posts on it. We have a spray bottle and I use a compressed air can to try to discipline him. I dont spray him directly with the air can, just around him so the hiss of air would scare him off. What ways can we stop this behavior and prevent other future bad behaviors?

1169,cats,"My cat is about 9 months old, and he‚Äôs always been pretty misbehaved despite our best efforts to block and redirect. Today, after days of trying to do so, he finally broke some strip lights in our kitchen by clawing them down and biting them. I was on a work call and could not get up to redirect him. We can‚Äôt use a humidifier in our room anymore because he‚Äôs obsessed with trying to get into the water tank. He seems to only do those things when we‚Äôre present but not actively playing with or feeding him. We‚Äôve had to use child locks on a number of cabinets and drawers because he will get into them and eat things. He has pica and will eat everything from q-tips to aluminum foil, so I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs going to eat something lethal.

1243,cats,"So I have a lot of kitties. Last year at around October, we lost two cats because of some sort of sickness that was going on. They had crusty eyes, had diarrhea, wouldn't eat or drink much. We took them to the vet,. quarantined them from the other cats, and two out of three got back to health. The second cat that died was in the living room. We almost lost a third one, but he was in the vet for a week due to being neutered; they figured out he was sick and on the brink of death, which is what made us realize the others were at risk.

Fast forward to now. Our cats will sometimes get crusty eyes again, puke some. It doesn't happen very often. It may be allergies or perhaps still the last remnants of the previous sickness. We feed and water them separately with different bowls, keep our house clean and sanitized, etc. We have an issue with fleas and ear mites we are trying to take care of though.

So with all of that background info...we decided to adopt two tiny kittens who are brother and sister. We went to Tractor Supply and got a kitten shot and gave it to the boy. I think a little bit of that shot didn't go in because he was squirming and it was difficult to give it to him; he and his sister are always full of energy. A few days later, the boy wasn't eating or drinking much. We gave him similar food that his birth home had and it didn't work. He began being VERY cuddly, to the point where he didn't want to play with his sister. No diahrea. No vomiting. No wet or crusty eyes. No stumbling. He just always wanted to cuddle up to us. I tucked him into a blanket and he didn't run out from it like how most cats do, he genuinely laid there and went to sleep. And he slept a lot. This happened for about two days until my wife and I came home from work yesterday and found him dead. His sister was running around the room playing with toys. We don't know what happened. Was it the shot? Was him cuddling due to him being cold? Did he have internal bleeding or injuries from us maybe rolling a leg or something on him when he slept with us at night? He had no sign of sickness from the last incident. No signs at all.",My kitten suddenly died and I have no idea why,1673977703,2138,46,421,10

2 years ago I moved into an apartment and he still finds a way to escape if we forget to lock the door. 
Because he went outside he had several injuries, infected wounds, paralyzed tail (permanently). Now after taking care of all of his wounds we decided to not to let him out anymore and make sure all the doors are locked. 
He has been giving us the hardest time ever. He pees everywhere, Especially on expensive stuff. And he seems to be doing it out of spite. We got him 2 different litter boxes, tried to reinforce him positively when he uses them. But he still keeps on doing it. 
He meows loudly all night, no stop, scratches at the door for hours. Sometimes he attacks me.

He's nice and the only one in there so he gets free reign of the whole cat room. Every time I go in to clean he runs up to me and rubs against my legs. He's recently started to stand on my knee and rub his face against mine when I'm kneeling.

Whenever he rubs against my leg or head I get tingles in the back of my head, the exact nice tingles you get when you listen to ASMR stuff. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Why does this happen? It's not like he's making a noise or even touching exposed skin most of the time, just rubbing against my clothes does it.

Also I swear to god this isn't sexual, the tingles are only in my head/scalp and I'm not insane. He's a very sweet cat and I'd never think of doing anything mean to him.",Does anyone else get a head tingly sensation when a cat rubs against their leg?,1673975219,1033,79,204,15

1296,cats,"In my hobby I do a bit of model painting, and resultantly I always have a mug of paint-water on my desk from washing brushes. I‚Äôve found my cat really likes drinking out of these mugs, and will repeatedly jump back up to drink from them after I drop her onto the carpet. Obviously paint water isn‚Äôt healthy so I stop her when I can (not letting her into room without me there etc), but today when she tried yet again (pawing out the water when she found she couldn‚Äôt reach it with her face); I was a little concerned and grabbed a used mug, washed it out and rinsed it (there were still paint lines but 90% was gone), then filled it with water and let her have some. She drank for nearly thirty seconds straight before leaving it to sit on my lap and then didn‚Äôt go back to it.

This obviously suggests she‚Äôs dehydrated, but she has a bowl of water next to her food which she has constant access to and is currently half full. I was wondering if anybody could suggest what the problem is, since I can only guess and I‚Äôd rather know so I can take better care of her.

Some misc info that might be useful:

She‚Äôs an older cat, a Burmese about 10-12 though I don‚Äôt know how old exactly. She‚Äôs only had this problem recently (maybe 6 months at most). One idea I had was maybe it‚Äôs getting hard for her to crane her neck low where the bowl is, and the mug being higher up helps?

The bowl we use is metal, I don‚Äôt know how often the waters replaced since it tends to get replaced only when it‚Äôs low or if it‚Äôs visibly not fresh. It‚Äôs possible she doesn‚Äôt like the metallic taste, or possibly the stagnant taste of the water if it‚Äôs not refilled regularly?

She lives in a room with our dog, they get on better than they used to and can now sit near to each other but she‚Äôs still very wary of him. Her bowls are far higher than the dog can reach, but still it may be possible she struggles to drink comfortably there because she‚Äôs anxious around him?

It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs just addicted to the chemicals in the paint, or just really likes the taste, but I‚Äòve tasted paint water before (accidentally) and it wasn‚Äôt pleasant so I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs see in it.

D needs to loose weight and although we are also trying to exercise him more, we also need to cut his food but we are having a hard time doing that and not also limiting the amount of food B has access to.

In addition B is an anxious little guy with a history of urinary problems so we have him on a special diet (which they both eat after get vet approval) but we don‚Äôt want to limit his access to food and stress him out and potentially cause another urinary blockage issue.

1334,cats,"Before I get into our problem, I'll give some details. So we got an 11 month male cat named Gimli a couple months ago from the local shelter, he's about 13 months old now. We decided he needs some company so a couple days ago we got a 2 month old male kitten named Inks. He's such a good boy, doesn't stop purring and didn't hiss or get aggressive towards Gimli at all when they met. Gimli only let out a couple hisses when they met which we expected.

Gimli follows Inks everywhere and will occasional jump at him, I think he's playing since he doesn't bap him hard he just kind of taps him. We only allow a small amount of this since Gimli is significantly bigger and we don't want him to hurt Inks. 

So here's our problem: 
When Inks runs, when he's chasing a toy or something, Gimli chases after him and attacks him, trying to pin him on his back and bite his neck I think, definitely not playing. On the first day there was a couple times where Inks has been sleeping and Gimli tried to bite his neck but he hasn't done this since. 

Here are my questions:
Is this to be expected with both cats ages?
Is Gimli trying to kill Inks? 
Does Gimli see a small animal running and think it's prey?
Is Gimli asserting his dominance?

Any tips help. At this time we're keeping them in separate rooms unless one is literally asleep on our lap. We also set up one of those Feliway calming diffusers to try to help the whole process.",Introducing a kitten to our junior cat,1673972579,1427,38,272,7

1343,cats,"I have four cats. One of them is very ill. He‚Äôs only 7. Basically his kidney function is in the can. My vet recommended aggressive fluids and frequent feeds. He also said it wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to recommend putting him down at this point either. He gave me the option of doing this either at an 24 hour emergency vet, go back and forth to his clinic daily, or give the fluids myself at home. I chose at home because if my cat is not able to get better from this, I would prefer that his last days be with me and not stressed from the hospital environment or the back and forth.

As you can imagine, it‚Äôs been a lot trying to feed him separately from my other cats, and offer it frequently enough to take advantage of whatever appetite he has. Then I‚Äôve gotta take it away because the other cats will get to it. Otherwise, I‚Äôve been trying to let him be in the house. Most of the time he sleeps in a dark room somewhere, but sometimes he‚Äôll come out to use the litter box or just kinda look around for a bit before returning to sleep. With all these meds and different food trials, he‚Äôs been a little messy. He‚Äôs not grooming himself, understandably. His poops are a bit loose and he‚Äôs leaking poop on surfaces around the house. 

Ideally, I wish I could leave the food out so he can eat whenever he wants instead of waiting for me and having to work around the other cats. Considering the food juggling, his leaky butt, that he needs to rest, and that he needs twice a day fluids and meds, would it be better to isolate him to a room? I‚Äôm having a hard time being objective about whether that is better for him, or is it more stressful on him to keep him separated? For what it‚Äôs worth, I have a pretty decent room option for him. I have a small unused office space on the first floor, maybe 7‚Äôx7‚Äô,  that has a window-paned door that allows him to see out. 

I think I‚Äôm just sleep deprived, emotionally tapped out, and I just want to do what‚Äôs best for him. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs better to give him his own little private space where he can eat and rest at his leisure, or if it‚Äôs better that he be able to roam as he pleases in order to give him a sense of normality. If the room is better, would you keep him there all day and night?

I know a neutered cat is usually better than not but should there be any behaviors in this initial meeting I should look for? They mentioned he could be a little nibbly when overstimulated but that could just be a playful instinct-type thing. He's also generally described as relaxed and laid back. (Obviously I have to meet him to truly see things for myself!)

Anyone know the percent chance of aggressive/spraying behaviors even after being neutered at the 3/4 yr mark? I especially ask this because I have a 1yr old (spayed) female cat at home that's quite a gentle, at times timid cat.

The title kind of explains it all, we're adopting a 5 month old kitten and I was wondering what advice might be out there. 
I've been watching some stuff on YT and have a cat care book which has been helpful but I'm sure there's stuff I have heard/seen.

We've already got a cat tree, scratching post, and two litter trays and will be using the same food and litter as the shelter to help her settle in. 

The kitten is also up to date on vaccinations, has been microchipped, and is negative for all the common nasty viruses (not sure she's been spayed cos of her age but plan on checking).

Any advice on getting the kitten settled, behaviour/training, and good enrichment toys would be fab or just anything you think would be worthwhile to know!

I grew up in a dog household - my family really doesn't like cats, and I've been made fun of for mentioning that I enjoyed a few of my friends' quirky felines. So I don't really have a knowledge base outside of visiting friends and some research.  

I'm allergic to some cats (severely allergic, like eyes swelling shut) and don't react at all to others. I know the rescue I'm going to go to and they've been lovely and said I am welcome to meet their cats and see if I'm allergic or not. I'm saving up for an air purifier and nice vacuum to help keep things cleaned up. 

It'll take me 6-12 months to save up for supplies and stuff, but I wanted to ask cat Reddit what my ""here's what you need to know"" listicles and blogs missed, or any advice you have on finding my new best fur friend. 

A few outstanding questions:

- can you teach cats to stay off of kitchen counters and tables? Some friends said yes and others say no. 

- would a first time cat owner be better off adopting a kitten/younger cat or an adult/senior cat? 

- I know declawing is really awful - one of my roommates is concerned that a cat with claws would destroy the furniture. How do you prevent unwanting scratching? 

- cat litter. Why are there so many options. What should I actually look for, other than low dust?

* Waking you up in the middle of the night because he wants to play/go to the balcony.
* Calls for you because he needs to go to the toilet and wants you to be there.
* Sit at his food plate and looks at one of us as if he does not have food. We pick up the plate, mix the food a bit and place it back. he starts eating.

1476,cats,"Tl;dr My 2 cats + I had to move in with my siblings + their 2 cats due to family circumstances. If we don‚Äôt keep them separated, my one cat always attacks and ends up hurting the other two. It‚Äôs been 2 months - is there any hope to fix this?

Trigger Warning: brief suicide mention

Due to a family member getting really sick, I had to move back home, and ended up moving in with my sister and BIL. They have 2 cats and I also have 2 cats. It‚Äôs a lot, I totally get it, but we have the space. 

We anticipated a rough adjustment period, but we did NOT anticipate what‚Äôs happening: if our cats are out for even 10 minutes, my one cat immediately attacks my sister‚Äôs cats. My other cat has attacked her cats occasionally too, and he‚Äôs twice their size, so he‚Äôs hurting them almost as bad as my first cat. She been the worst tho, she spends every second stalking them if we‚Äôre not watching her, and she has to be physically pulled off the other cat when she catches one of them. She‚Äôs really hurting them‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre terrified of leaving my sister‚Äôs room, and I‚Äôm terrified of her causing even worse damage than she‚Äôs already doing. 

Admittedly, it‚Äôs been a hard move all around, and we think we need to spend more time actively socializing them before trying nuclear options. However, my cat has always been like this. The shelter told me she was a sweetheart, but due to some suspected abuse, wouldn‚Äôt get along with people or other cats, and had been marked to be released after her spay surgery. I took a chance on her, and ended up with the sweetest, weirdest little cat. We meow back and forth all the time, she does tricks like high five and sit, and I love the crap out of her. 

Unfortunately, then I adopted a second cat from a friend in an emergency situation, and everything went downhill. They never got along, but because the new cat was bigger, he could hold his own against her. They mellowed out eventually (almost 6 mo. later), but they still got in pretty bad fights at least once a week and my first rescue started peeing on my bed to mark her territory. This has been going on for a little over two years before this move. 

This is adding an insane layer of stress to everyone in the household, but what are my options? They can‚Äôt just stay separated in our tiny bedrooms forever. They‚Äôre all starting to display bad stress symptoms like chewing themselves/our plants, the continued peeing on beds, and bad separation anxiety. How are we supposed to hold out possibly 6+ mo. just for them to MAYBE get along?

Moving out isn‚Äôt an option for me, so the only other option I can think of is to rehome my cats‚Ä¶ even tho my cats clearly preferred being single cats in a house, I feel like I‚Äôm just giving up on them. My first rescue has only ever gotten along with me, so idk who I could even give her to, and I also can‚Äôt live without cats: My first cat was adopted on recommendation from my therapist as an ESA after a (thankfully) failed suicide attempt, and she‚Äôs been my only rock throughout some insane life circumstances. So I know I would need to adopt a new cat almost immediately, but that just makes me feel even more like I‚Äôm throwing away my ‚Äúold toys‚Äù for something new‚Ä¶

Am I kidding myself thinking we can just socialize away this behavior? Is rehoming them the right call? I could use any advice or tips on this.",Emergency advice needed!! My cat is actively seeking out and attacking our other cats.,1673962976,3341,86,624,14

I got my first cat this week, and I've been binge watching plenty of cat tips videos but it seems like 99% of the advice is to go to the vet. Cat sneezes? Go to the vet. Cat not sleeping where she normally does? Go to the vet. Cat meows a lot? Go to the vet. Cat eating a lot?  Go to the vet. Which makes me wonder how much does going to the vet cost? I mean if going to the vet is such a common advice for everything the cat does, then it couldn't cost that much in the first place, right? I would hate to take my cat to the vet because it's started using it's right paw instead of it's left paw, vet tells me the cat is normal, and then charge me $1000 for the visit alone.

I give them varieties of wet food and the dry food that they're used to in their previous home, but to no avail, they're just tasting them. Just a few bites, and that's it.

 Also, they're scared of me. Whenever I approach them, they run away and hide, but they love it when I brush their fur. That's where they're being affectionate, and their purring is loud. The good thing is they already got used to the litter boxes and have no problem in using it. It's just their appetite, I'm kind of getting stressed cause they won't eat that much, considering they're big cats. I gave them 2 sticks of treats earlier, and they finished it. 

Any suggestions/tips on what should I do? Should I just let them be? Like ignore, and give them space?

I took him to the vet &amp; based on what I told him they think it's behavioral &amp; not medical &amp; that I basically need to figure out why he's doing it. So I assumed it was anxiety because he's a real scarey cat &amp; I have 2 kids so sometimes the noise scares them. ( I have 4 cats.)

1568,cats,"**TW** in TL;DR: my neighbour is abusive to his pets and the police wont help. Its the middle of the night so i emailed animal bylaw, will post updates on the situation

So I'm feeling a little lost right now. I've been living in my building for about 6 years almost and the guy in the building across from me is a nightmare. Our balconys are across from eachother so its a chore to make sure I ignore him (hes so loud about his personal life). I won't go too into detail, but he's got a girlfriend and a kid who he's verbally abused on multiple occasions, I've heard it in my bedroom and I've witnessed him do it on the street. He's a horrible dude. They've had physical fights too and cops have been involved.

Well now the girlfriend and kid aren't in the picture cause they broke up (again) and he's turned his anger towards his cats. He left them outside last week for 12+hrs in the rain without food, water, shelter or litter. He's a few stories up too so they make me so nervous when they pace the railing. We reported it once we noticed it had been about a couple hrs (I WFH and was checking between calls) and animal control finally showed up but it took a while.

So tonight, at 12am, he comes outside and yells ""mind your own business about my ****ing cats,"" and throws one of them onto the balcony and then slams the door. I waited an hr because my local police dept won't do anything if we call sooner, and then reported it to the non emergency line. Then at about 1:50am the officer calls me and says she's gonna refer it to bylaw instead. I mentioned the cat has been crying for 2 hours straight and has no food, water or shelter and that it's a cold rainy night. She refused to do anything. I asked if she could do a wellness check cause the fact he did that is a sign of being mentally unwell and she got mad and legit ranted at me about how busy they are (considering I got all this done pretty quickly tonight it doesn't seem like a busy Monday but I'll take their word for it...) and stated she wouldn't be modifying the report. I asked if the cat dies of neglect, who would this be on? I even said, ""I know that sounds dramatic but we don't know it's current health status."" She refused to answer and repeated she'd be emailing animal bylaw about this.

I emailed animal bylaw myself cause I don't trust her to do it with the way she sounded irritated in the first place and I'm just wondering if there's anything else I can do? I also already filed a complaint about the experience and made sure to mention in the email to animal bylaw that I'd be willing to temp foster or for sure sponsor the care of the cats if they ended up taken from him.

I just find it so frustrating how the SPCA website says to call the police, but they refuse to help, so there's no help for animals between 5pm-8am.

I am new to reddit and would love to get some community advice on how to help my best friend and pet, Gypsy the cat.

She is a 13 year old tortoise shell.

She has always been a thin cat. But lately she has been a bit off her food and has slowly stopped eating as much. I see a lot of my friends cats look healthier and if anything, look slightly over weight.

I really want to get some more weight on her in a healthy way. 

She currently eats a mix of wet and dry food. But really isn‚Äôt eating as much as she should.

Can anyone please offer some advice on how I can beef her up please? I am starting to become concerned and have considered taking her to a vet.

Thank you so much in advance redditors!",How to help my cat gain weight?,1673939782,716,31,144,7

1663,cats,"I have a seven year old cat who has a history of toileting behavioral problems when introduced to a new environment. 

A new environment is introduced and he will proceed to poop next to his litter box for the first couple of weeks. We have moved half a dozen times since I have had him and this is the reality each time. I‚Äôve always been able to deal with it by putting newspaper next to the litter box for the first couple of weeks until he starts using it.

Fast forward to today ‚Äî we just returned from a four month trip around the USA where we lived out of our pull behind trailer. He did great the whole trip with using his litter box ‚Äî no issues. We are now staying in a family lake house while anticipating the purchase of a home. No one else is here as my family only uses it during the summertime. About two weeks in the pooping outside of the litter box started. As soon as he started using his box to poop, he starting peeing outside of it.

He has never urinated on the ground to my knowledge. I took him to the vet to rule out a UTI, diabetes, or other renal issues. He had extensive blood work completed and he is healthy. I have tried cleaning litter boxes, adding new litter boxes, using puppy pads, deep cleaning the spots that he is urinating on (vinegar, enzymatic sprays, heavy duty carpet cleaners) and secluding him to different areas of the house as to not have access to those spots. He just finds a new spot on the ground to pee. Today, I put him in my dogs large crate for the day with his litter box, bed, and food and water while pondering what step to take next. 

I feel like I am exhausting all options. What else can I do to try to get him to use his box again?",Cat urinating outside of litter box,1673937409,1694,35,330,6

1665,cats,"I have two cats. Merlin is Miss Congeniality, he‚Äôs very inquisitive and engaging and friendly. (As an aside, the vet I take him to unilaterally gave him a first name they wrote down Mark Merlin?? Like he went from frat star to used car salesman? V funny stuff) 

Widget, on the other hand, hisses and attacks everyone who is not me. He does not run or hide. Instead, he sits with everyone else with a ‚Äúwe all have to be unhappy‚Äù vibe. It‚Äôs strange because if I‚Äôm not home he‚Äôll go sit near whoever else is home, but if they try to touch him or perceive him in any way, he‚Äôll attack. 

I adore widget, he is my little soul mate. He never attacks me and is a completely different cat around me. 

I have a boyfriend and we live together, and widget goes through phases of being mildly disinterested in him to fully hostile and doing Big Attacks. 

It‚Äôs not just the boyfriend. I had a roommate for a whole year and widget attacked her non stop. 

This causes many problems: (1) he will go to high traffic places and sort of box people in (ie the bathroom, a hallway, a kitchen) and will hiss and attack when you try to pass. (2) he has cerebellar hypoplasia, so he wobbles. When he attacks, he‚Äôll jump into a wall or bonk his chin on the ground, which rly upsets me 

I think part of the problem is that they try to engage with him. My old roommate would try to sneak pets or whatever, so I get why he never warmed up to her. My boyfriend is pretty good about not being noisy, giving the cat space, letting the cat come to him, giving him treats, etc and widget still just hates him.

Widget used to hate Merlin as well, but Merlin is persistent-he just let widget attack him  and just punch his face over and over and now they are on the warmer side of frenemies. They cuddle and bath each other and play together but their play eventually becomes pretty vicious. They also bathe each other rather aggressively and that often devolves into Serious Fighting. V toxic Merlin needs to wake up and realize he deserves better but he wants it bad, that bad romance; he‚Äôs caught in a bad romance.

1715,cats,"Hi! I recently found out my cousin is fostering a little kitten. I came to visit him today and met the cat, he‚Äôs super cuddly and not fussy at all.

I was thinking I could take him because I live alone for most of the year since I study 2 hours away from my hometown. My mother is a serious pet hater (i‚Äôm exaggerating), she just doesn‚Äôt like the mess and puts them up for adoption within a month so it seems like a good idea. Between school breaks I can take him to a pet sitter until the semester starts again. 

I have my mother‚Äôs blessing under the condition that the cat doesn‚Äôt stink up the house and doesn‚Äôt damage the furniture. 

How can I train him to do his business in the cat litter and not scratch our stuff? Is it possible? I would like to know before I adopt him. 

I would like to clarify that I‚Äôve never been a cat owner. Also, if I end up not adopting it, we‚Äôre making sure he‚Äôs well taken care of and safe.",I might be adopting a cat soon and I need some advice on a series of things,1673931272,926,75,183,17

1718,cats,"Hello. I just adopted my first ever cat. She is about 5 months old. I noticed that she tends to knead a lot‚Ä¶ maybe when she‚Äôs nervous? I‚Äôm not sure why she does it. The issue is, she kneads with her claws. It‚Äôs pretty painful for me but I just put a blanket over my lap. The bigger issue is she does it on my bed and couch. Over time she‚Äôs gonna shred my bedding and couch. Do cats tend to knead with their claws like that into adulthood? Or is it just a nervous kitten thing? Any suggestions to teach her to stop?

1736,cats,"I (17F) have a brother (13M) and we both have cats. I have a 1 year old boy and he has a 3 month old girl. We've had both of them since they were kittens (found the 3 month old alone in a box on the in an alley we walk through after school when she was only afew days old and got the 1 year old when he was 3 months because my aunt took in a stray that ended up being pregnant and couldn't keep the 2 surviving kittens)

They have both been to the vet and been dewormed, treated with flea remover, tested for all sorts of diseases and health conditions, neutered (getting the 3 month old spayed in a week), and they are both healthy.

My brother isn't the best with animals, he did literally no research after getting the kitten and just expected me to do everything despite insisting she is only his cat, would refuse to clean the litter box, I was the one waking up every few hours to feed the kitten formula, I was the one who had to work on switching her over to wet food, and I've been the one doing all the hard work while he just smothers the poor kitten, I even switched to the online program my school offers so I can be there to take care of the kitten. He will move the kitten around like a doll and even throws her to me ""as a joke"" but that could seriously hurt her.

Due to all this, the kitten has naturally become scared of him. We keep the cats in our bedrooms since we both have very large bedrooms and my dad doesn't like cats but this kitten hates being in my brother's room, you will have to physically force her to enter and even then the second the door opens she will just run and go straight to my door and wait until someone opens it for her.

She loves cuddling me but will actively run from my brother and scratch him whenever she gets picked up by him. She will hiss, bite, and scratch to get away but will just purr and cuddle me whenever I'm in the same room.

I've tried to ask my parents if I can keep the kitten in my room as my cat since my current cat is very bonded to her and since she clearly prefers me along with my brother being a terrible pet owner but so far they've been saying no and that they will talk to my brother about taking better care of her but he has shown no signs of changing. How can I convince them that he is a horrible owner and shouldn't be the one owning this kitten, I'm also scared of what will happen to this kitten when I move out since he may be bored of her when she's bigger and more capable of defending herself. If he keeps mistreating her she'll likely develop aggressive behavior and I don't want her to suffer with him.",How can I convince my parents to give me my brother's cat,1673929446,2595,57,515,12

1769,cats,"Hello. I'm crying as I'm writing this right now. I adopted a 3 month old kitten around a week ago, and he's been such a sweet boy. He plays and cuddles with me too. But ever since getting him, I've had extreme anxiety and been stressed out. For some context, I'm 16 y/o. I've wanted a pet since I was young and when my cat came home I agreed that I would be the main care-taker. I also have a little sister who enjoys playing with him. Theres a few reason's why I was wondering if I should return him.

1. I live with my parents and my mom is really scared of animals, and she's been telling me that she doesn't think she'll get over her fear. We're also vegetarian due to religious reasons and my mom didn't realize that cats would eat meat (no hate towards her she's never had an animal).
2. I'm at school most of the time, and on weekends doing other activities. My mom said I don't have enough time to take care of him and she's gonna have to end up taking care of him.
3. He's always energetic. I try to play with him when I can, and feel really shitty when I can't. It feels like I'm not giving him enough attention. It's also draining me to play with him all the time while managing school and other things. I'm constantly worrying over things with him.
4. A few days after he came home we had to go to the vet because he licked his spayed area too much, so that's added onto my anxiety with him. I'm afraid his health will go down, and I think that fear is worse since he had a health issue as soon as we got him. I also don't want my parents to have to start excessively worry about vet bills.
5. I'm going to college in 1.5-2 years and I'm worried whether I can take him with me or not. What if my dorm doesn't allow pet? Will I have to get an apartment?
6. I haven't been able to focus on schoolwork at all since he came, so my grades have gone down a bit.

I'm scared that I'll continue feeling this way and end up having to return him in the future when he's even more attached to me, I have no idea what to do. I read so many posts on people feeling this way but it's not helping.",New Kitten causing lot of stress-- should I return him?,1673927406,2094,55,419,10

Since joining just a few days ago, I‚Äôve seen a post where an owner filmed a very long video of their kitten being overpowered by a full grown cat and squealing in pain/fear, someone asking if they should give a tiny weeks old kitten to a pitbull home and then pushing back when people said no, and today a post about a cat drooling uncontrollably whose owner won‚Äôt take them to the vet immediately because they don‚Äôt have money for an Uber. 

I believe that people should be able to put up sad content and even ask for medical advice if they‚Äôre in an emergency situation, but I‚Äôm noticing a trend of irresponsible/neglectful owners posting triggering content and then refusing to follow the advice that we urgently provide. I‚Äôm sure all of us reading these posts feel upset and helpless. I can‚Äôt understand what the motivations behind these posts are and I‚Äôm wondering how we can address them as a community.

1815,cats,"Hello,  


I am a student who lives in a small studio apartment. Like something between 30 and 35 square meters (322-376 square feet).   


I already have a cat with me. She has lots of climbing opportunities, elevated spots, many beds and places to hide and a cat tree, as well as numerous scratching posts. I even put up a bed at the window so she can have fun looking outside.  


I really love this cat a lot. She is so lovely, I see her as my own daughter.   


Well, recently, I found a cat online that's up for adoption. The cat is disabled. Not to a point, where it cannot walk at all anymore, it just has difficulties walking. And I honestly feel so bad for the cat and I'd love to take care of it, especially because I'm at home most of the time since I study from home.

I've always been a huge cat lover, especially because I also grew up with cats in my parents' home. I just couldn't help but feel my heart break as I read the description of the cat on the internet.  


Do you guys think it's possible for me to adopt this cat or should I just hope that someone else will take care of this cat well? 

I'm just so afraid for that cat because it's a breed cat. It's a siamese cat. I'm scared that someone will adopt it just because of its breed and with no intention to actually take care of it. I have this belief because I know how cruel some humans can be.

1823,cats,"So, I adopted a stray cat a while ago, however since he had an eye removed, we had to keep him away from my other cats, in one room. We let him out to wonder around after his eye was just a scab, and he‚Äôs getting along (mostly) with my other cats, there‚Äôs a few hisses here and there, but he‚Äôs ok with them.

However, I‚Äôve noticed that after he eats, he always has to pee, and he ends up peeing on the floor. He did that while I fed him as a stray too. 

Google isn‚Äôt giving me a good answer, considering it‚Äôs not because of a problem with the litter, just because he‚Äôs either use to it, or he marks his territory. 

The vet also said that it‚Äôs not a medical issue.

So any tips?","People who adopted stray (or any) cats, how did you stop them from peeing around the house?",1673924022,679,91,137,17

Me and my girlfriend just got nausica√§ about a week ago. We didn‚Äôt show them to each other for the first day. But Aztec was very interested in the crate. We have her, her own room with stuff of his scent so she could start to get used to it. Then 2 days after we started a supervised play date. Nausica√§ started to hiss at him and we let them be for a bit cause we know that‚Äôs normal. We then closed them out from each other and let Nauica√§ explore the apartments. Fast forward to now, we still have to do supervised play dates and Nausica√§ still hisses and growls. If Aztec jumps on her to try to play, she then tries to get away and immediately snarls.

I been very curious to see what sort of new current cat research is being conducted and were to find these resources?

I was reading it wasn‚Äôt until the 80s that we even began to really dive into dog research. Id imagine the same is true for cats and there must be some new discoveries! 

I think the perception that cats are aloof is breaking down and that the general population is learning that they are much social than previously thought. Would love to hear about all the new factoids we are learning about cats!

My senior (almost 15) cat consistently poops and pees on the litter mat directly in front of the litter box instead of inside and I need advice!

To provide context, she was our only cat until about 2 years ago. Therefore, she (happily) lived most of her life as a single cat but in the last two years: we adopted a kitten, moved, and started living with another cat (belongs to roommate, total of 3 cats). Since then she has off and on been urinating and pooping outside the litter box. It is always directly outside on the mat and never elsewhere in the house. 

We took her to the vet to ensure it was not a health issue and the vet said she is perfectly healthy and it is likely a behavioral issue, probably territorial. It feels like we have tried everything (different litter, different litter boxes, more litter boxes, cleaning more often, feliway, different litter mats, keeping roommate‚Äôs cat from using at least one litter box, taking the lid off, etc.). She will do it even if the litter boxes are completely clean with all fresh litter. The only thing that seems to have temporarily stopped the behavior was taking her to the vet . They didn‚Äôt actually do anything beside a check-up but we think she may have seen it as a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù. 

Our roommate will be moving out and taking her cat with her soon which we hope will alleviate the issue. But the behavior is escalating and she pees daily and poops multiple times a day outside the box and it is driving us crazy/damaging our floors. Has anyone else experienced this and/or have any advice?

I just did scoop it and have him separated in another room with his box so I‚Äôll see if he goes.

He was taken by my gf today to Pet ER because no vets were available till tomorrow and we were scared to wait further. They said everything checked out okay besides a low fever of 103.5. They gave him fluids, medicine for appetite, did some blood tests and a test for the fever and said he can be treated as an out patient. They‚Äôre going to call us tomorrow to check up on him and hopefully have blood results.

Now I mainly made this because I‚Äôm an over thinker who gets anxiety and I really do love my boy and I‚Äôm just trying to see if anyone else has other thoughts or things I can do to help his appetite and possibly his recovery.

They come and go so I don‚Äôt know if the spots are caused by the licking/itching or if she‚Äôs licking/itching because of the spots. She also has some hair loss. She‚Äôs been to the vet twice recently for this and they are suspecting allergies‚Ä¶ Only neither Claritin nor Chlorpheniramine are helping. Wouldn‚Äôt the antihistamines not helping contradict an allergy diagnosis? Does anyone have any advice or ideas for what this could be that I could talk to her vet about? It‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch her be so uncomfortable. 

Other things to note: She‚Äôs indoor only and our other cat is perfectly fine. She‚Äôs been given a round of Revolution in case it was ticks or parasites. This all started a couple days after she got her first FeLV vaccine but I don‚Äôt discount the fact that could be coincidental and the itching could be unrelated to that.",Itchy Kitten - Advice needed,1673916197,994,28,172,5

1959,cats,"So, I have a 1 year old cat, Butter, who is 90% indoors, but most days when I‚Äôm working from home I let him out on my apartment porch for a couple hours or take him on a walk in the court yard. He‚Äôs pretty well bonded to me and doesn‚Äôt stray further from about 10 meters from me at any given time. 

Anyway, just now I heard Butter hiss for the first time since I had him. There was another cat in my porch making those deep aggressive meows and giving Butter the eye. Butter seemed more curious and scared than aggressive. He‚Äôs never been around other cats. 

I came out to meet this new cat. Well fed, clean and with a bell on his collar. Wasn‚Äôt at all scared of me, and actually seemed nice enough. But he‚Äôs also super bold. I kind of pushed him off my porch wall, and he seemed like he was walking away, but just as I‚Äôm writing this post he literally swaggered right into my apt, looking for Butter who was thankfully hiding under the couch. 

 Not really sure what to do in this situation. I‚Äôd hate to deny Butter what little outside stimulation he gets. But I mean, if this new cat 
Decides my porch is his territory, what can I do?","New cat in the neighborhood, acting aggressive towards my cat.",1673915869,1138,62,221,10

1966,cats,"Hi everyone, 

  
My cat is a two-year-old male cat named Gibbs, and he is currently living with my mom in Florida while I attend school in another state. He is around my mom's other cats, and when I visited today over winter break, I noticed a significant hold on the side of my cat. I asked my mom what had happened, and she said it must have just happened recently, which worried both of us. We have a vet appointment scheduled for Wednesday, but if anybody has any insight on what this could be, that would be greatly appreciated. I thought maybe it was one of those bot files, but my mom is adamant that could not be the case since my cat had not been outside recently. I know that one of her other cats and my cat get into fights pretty often, but it is usually nothing beyond a few swats. I also don't think a teeth mark could make that big of a hole. He doesn't seem to be in pain and is currently lying on it as he sleeps and will roll over on it, but I know cats can often hide their pain. So I am wondering if anybody had something similar to this happen to their pet while we waited for the vet appointment on Wednesday. Because I am currently freaking out about what this could be.",My cat has a hole on his side,1673915329,1194,29,233,8
